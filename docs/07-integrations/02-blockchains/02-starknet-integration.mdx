# Starknet Integration

Calimero is in the process of integrating with Starknet, which will soon allow
users to interact with the Starknet ecosystem. This integration will enable
authentication, data reading, and writing on Starknet, opening up opportunities
for leveraging its scalability and zero-knowledge technology. As this feature
develops, users will be able to integrate Starknetâ€™s capabilities into their
workflows.
