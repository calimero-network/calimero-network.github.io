# Internet Computer Protocol Integration

Calimeroâ€™s integration with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is underway,
aiming to connect users with the decentralized services offered by ICP. Once
complete, users will be able to authenticate and interact with data on the ICP
network, facilitating communication with a highly scalable and decentralized
infrastructure. The upcoming integration will provide even greater flexibility
for developers and users to build on and connect to ICP.
