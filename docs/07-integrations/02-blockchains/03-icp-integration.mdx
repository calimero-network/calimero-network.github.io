# Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Integration

Calimero offers integration with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), allowing users to authenticate using their Internet Identity (II). This integration provides a secure and user-friendly way to access the Admin Dashboard using ICP's robust authentication system.

## Logging in with Internet Identity

The login process with Internet Identity involves these key steps:

### 1. User Initiates Login
- The user navigates to the Admin Dashboard and selects the option to "Login with Internet Identity."

### 2. Challenge Preparation
- The system prepares a challenge (encoded as a session public key) before initiating the authentication process.

### 3. Internet Identity Authentication
- A popup window opens, connecting to the Internet Identity service.
- The user authenticates through this popup.
- The challenge (session public key) is sent to the II service.

### 4. Delegation Chain Retrieval
- Upon successful authentication, the II service creates and returns a delegation chain.
- This delegation chain includes cryptographic proofs of the user's authentication.

### 5. Processing the Authentication Result
- The application receives the delegation chain from the II service.
- It processes this data, extracting necessary information like the user's public key.

### 6. Login Request Preparation
- The application prepares a login request including:
  - The serialized delegation chain
  - The original challenge payload
  - Wallet metadata (ICP canister ID and wallet name)

### 7. Server-side Verification
- The login request is sent to the Calimero server.
- The server verifies the delegation chain and challenge.

### 8. Successful Login
- Upon successful verification, the user is logged in and directed to the identity page.
- The user's Internet Identity becomes their unique identifier for future interactions within the Calimero ecosystem.

This process leverages ICP's delegation chain mechanism for secure, decentralized authentication.

## Current Limitations

### Authentication-Only Functionality
- At present, the ICP integration is primarily focused on authentication and login functionality.

## Future Developments

We are actively working on expanding the ICP integration to include:

1. **Read Operations**: Implementing secure methods to read data from the Internet Computer.
2. **Write Operations**: Developing functionality for users to perform write operations on ICP canisters.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance our ICP integration capabilities.
