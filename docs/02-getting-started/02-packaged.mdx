### Next Steps

Initialize and run node

If this is your first time initializing the node, the process may take a little
bit more time until all dependencies are downloaded. It will take around 7
minutes but can vary depending on your internet connection.

#### 1. Initialize node

```bash title="Terminal"
merod --node-name node1 init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
```

Node configuration file contains protocol defined metada and is located at
`~/.calimero/your_node_name/config.toml`.

#### 2. Run node

```bash title="Terminal"
merod --node-name node1 run
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.
