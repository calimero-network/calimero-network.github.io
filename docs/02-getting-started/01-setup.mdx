# Setup

This guide will help you set up Calimero in your device.

There are two main paths:

1. **Install via Script or Homebrew** (Recommended): Quickly install `meroctl`
   for most users.
2. **Build from Source**: For developers who want to contribute or modify the
   framework.

## Supported Platforms

Calimero currently supports the following operating systems and architectures:

- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Linux
- **Architectures**: x86_64, arm64 (Apple Silicon)

If your platform is not supported, please
[create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/issues).

## Install via Script or Homebrew (Recommended)

You can choose to install `meroctl` using either the installation script or
Homebrew.

### **Option 1: Installation Script**

The installation script supports multiple terminal environments and will
automatically configure your PATH based on your shell.

#### Steps

1. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calimero-network/core/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Source the updated PATH:

   ```bash
   source <your-shell-config-file>
   ```

   Replace `<your-shell-config-file>` with `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or the relevant
   configuration file for your shell.

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   meroctl --version
   ```

If the version number appears, the installation was successful.

#### Notes for Shell Environments

The script automatically updates your PATH based on your shell configuration:

- **Bash**: Updates `.bashrc`.
- **Zsh**: Updates `.zshrc`.
- **Fish**: Modifies `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
- **Csh/Tcsh**: Updates `.cshrc`.

To apply the changes immediately, use the `source` command as described in step
2 above.

### **Option 2: Homebrew**

If you use Homebrew, you can install `meroctl` directly with the following
steps:

#### Steps

1. Add the Calimero Homebrew tap:

   ```bash
   brew tap calimero-network/homebrew-tap
   ```

2. Install `meroctl`:

   ```bash
   brew install meroctl
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   meroctl --version
   ```

If the version number appears, the installation was successful.

## Build from Source (For Contributors)

If you want to contribute to the Calimero framework or customize its
functionality, you can build it from source.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Rust is installed. If not, follow the instructions on the
  [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Troubleshooting

- If Rust dependencies fail, ensure your Rust installation is up-to-date:

  ```bash
  rustup update
  ```

- Verify that you have all required permissions to run the node.

For further support, open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/issues).

### Setup steps

Setup consists of few steps and is around 10 minutes long. (mostly waiting for
project dependencies to download)

1. Clone repository from GitHub (1min)
2. Position in the root of the project (< 1min)
3. Create a data folder for all configuration files (< 1min)
4. Initialize and run node (~7 mins)

### 1. Clone repository from GitHub

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ssh"
    values={[
        {label: 'SSH', value: 'ssh'},
        {label: 'HTTPS', value: 'https'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="https">
```bash title="Clone using HTTPS"
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/core.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ssh">
```bash title="Clone using SSH"
git clone git@github.com:calimero-network/core.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Position in the root of the project

```bash title="Terminal"
cd core
```

### 3. Create a data folder for all configuration files.

```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir data
```

### 4. Initialize and run node

You can do it in two ways.

- Using CLI
- Using Docker compose

If this is your first time initializing the node, the process may take a little
bit more time until all dependencies are downloaded. It will take around 7
minutes but can vary depending on your internet connection.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="cli"
    values={[
        {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
        {label: 'Docker Compose', value: 'docker'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

#### 1. Initialize node

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
```

> **_NOTE:_** A `--protocol` flag defines protocol for the context. Currently,
> we support Starknet and NEAR protocol. By default, the protocol is set to NEAR
> protocol, but you can set it explicitly to Starknet by using the following
> command:
>
> ```bash title="Terminal"
> cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528 --protocol starknet
> ```

> You can also view these settings in the config.toml file located within the
> node folder.
>
> ![NearConfig](/init/near-config.png) >![SnConfgi](/init/sn-config.png)

#### 2. Run node

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data run
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.

When you see something like this that means that node is now ready for use.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

#### 1. First build the image

```bash title="Terminal"
docker buildx build -t 'merod' .
```

#### 2. Then setup and run the nodes defined in `docker-compose.yml` file

```bash title="Terminal"
docker compose up
```

#### 3. Connect to the available node by listing running containers

```bash title="Terminal"
docker ps
```

and then attach to the selected container

```bash title="Node Terminal"
docker attach core-app_node_run-1
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.
