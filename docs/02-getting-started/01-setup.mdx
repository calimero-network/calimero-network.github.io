   contribute or modify the framework.

- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Linux

### Next Steps

Initialize and run node

If this is your first time initializing the node, the process may take a little
bit more time until all dependencies are downloaded. It will take around 7
minutes but can vary depending on your internet connection.

#### 1. Initialize node

```bash title="Terminal"
merod --node-name node1 init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
```

Node configuration file contains protocol defined metada. Node file is located
under `~/.calimero` folder.

#### 2. Run node

```bash title="Terminal"
merod --node-name node1 run
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.

When you see something like this that means that node is now ready for use.
