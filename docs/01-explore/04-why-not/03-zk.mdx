## Why not ZK?

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) solutions focus on enhancing privacy and reducing the need to reveal data during synchronization, but they don't eliminate the need for synchronization itself.

## Calimero vs ZK

Calimero offers a fundamentally different approach with local-first execution and eventual consistency, minimizing synchronization overhead. Additionally, ZK solutions can complement Calimero by providing enhanced privacy features within its framework, offering the best of both worlds without inheriting the synchronization complexities of traditional ZK implementations.
