## Why not ZK?

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) solutions focus on enhancing privacy and reducing the need
to reveal data during synchronization, but they don't eliminate the need for
synchronization itself.

## Calimero vs ZK

Calimero offers a fundamentally different approach with local-first execution
and eventual consistency, minimizing synchronization overhead. Additionally, ZK
solutions can complement Calimero by providing enhanced privacy features within
its framework, offering the best of both worlds without inheriting the
synchronization complexities of traditional ZK implementations.
