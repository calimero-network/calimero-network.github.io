Only Peers is a decentralized social networking app that empowers you to share your thoughts and engage with your community without compromising your privacy. It allows you to write posts, leave comments, and interact with friends. However, unlike traditional social networks, Only Peers ensures your data remains under your control, protected from central authorities and prying eyes. Experience the freedom of a decentralized platform where your voice cannot be censored and your privacy is prioritized. Explore the source code on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/only-peers-client).
