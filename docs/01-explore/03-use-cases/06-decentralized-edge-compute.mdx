title: Decentralized Edge Compute
---

Most of the general compute today happens on cloud service because that is where most of the data lives. With Calimero, all the applications data is stored locally, whereas Calimero enables edge compute on that data. Combined with the use of decentralized AI and Edge Inference LLMs, there are numerous use cases how Calimero can enhance user experience: Edge AI on users data for social spam filtering, e-commerce shopping recommendations across channels, to name a few. This would allow users to finally maximize the endless possibilities from their data, on their own rules.

For example, when you used to purchase from a certain merchant, the data was fully controlled by that merchant or the platform where the data was hosted, which would yield to your recommendations being exclusively tied to that merchant. But if the data would have lived on your device, your data recommendations would have been across various market channels, and not exclusively tied to that specific merchant.
