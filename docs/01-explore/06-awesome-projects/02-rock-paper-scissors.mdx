title: Rock Paper Scissors
---

A popular game we all know and love, but this time played online and enforcing
complete security using the commit - reveal scheme. After you pick your choice
of either rock, paper or scissors, you encrypt your choice with a password. This
ensures the other player canâ€™t see your choice. After your opponent has also
decided, it is time to reveal your password and determine the winner. You cannot
change your mind between choosing and revealing because your choice is locked
with the special password. This prevents any bad actors from changing their
minds in the middle of the game.Have fun with a classic game that is completely
fair and private! Explore the source code on
