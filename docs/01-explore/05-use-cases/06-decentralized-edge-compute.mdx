title: Decentralized Edge Compute
---

Most of the general compute today happens on cloud service because that is where
most of the data lives. With Calimero, all the applications data is stored
locally, whereas Calimero enables edge compute on that data. Combined with the
use of decentralized AI and Edge Inference LLMs, there are numerous use cases
how Calimero can enhance user experience: Edge AI on users data for social spam
filtering, e-commerce shopping recommendations across channels, to name a few.
This would allow users to finally maximize the endless possibilities from their
data, on their own rules.

For example, when you used to purchase from a certain merchant, the data was
fully controlled by that merchant or the platform where the data was hosted,
which would yield to your recommendations being exclusively tied to that
merchant. But if the data would have lived on your device, your data
recommendations would have been across various market channels, and not
exclusively tied to that specific merchant.
