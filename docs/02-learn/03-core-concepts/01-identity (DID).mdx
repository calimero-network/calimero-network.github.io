## Calimero Decentralized Identity

Calimeroâ€™s decentralized identity framework is designed to provide secure, anonymous, and decentralized control across the network. It leverages multiple types of cryptographic keys to manage identities and ensure the integrity of operations within the network.

### Network identity

Network identity is defined within the configuration file on each node. This identity is derived from [network keys](#network-keys), which generate a unique `Peer ID` for each node, allowing peers to identify themselves to other peers in the network.

#### Network Keys

Network keys are used to authenticate nodes within the network, with each node having a unique private-public key pair that it uses to verify its identity to other nodes.
During connection setup, nodes exchange public keys to ensure they are communicating with the intended parties. More in [Learn - Network](./node/network#identify)

### Context identity

Context identity allows users to identify themselves within a specific context. Users can have arbitrary number of identities within a specific context which remains encapsulated within the context.
These identities are linked to [runtime keys](#runtime-keys), with each context identity connected to one runtime key.

### Decentralized Identity (DID) document

All context-specific identities and node keys are managed through a Decentralized Identity (DID) document stored on the node. This document includes:

- [Root Keys](#root-keys)
- [Client Keys](#client-keys)
- [Runtime Keys](#runtime-keys)
- [Encryption Keys](#encryption-keys)

Calimero's key management utilizes multiple keys for various purposes, ensuring secure, anonymous, and decentralized control across the network.
This structure underpins secure and efficient operations within the Calimero Network, facilitating both node and application functionalities.

#### Root keys

Root keys provide full access for node operations, including managing root keys, listing identifiers, and generating new client keys.
Web3 wallets can be used as fundamental for root keys, simplifying the setup process.

<!--
**Key Initialization Process**:

1. **Starting Without Keys**: Initially, nodes have no keys. The addition of the first key is crucial for setting up application identities.
2. **Adding the First Key**:

   - In the node admin UI, connect a wallet, such as MetaMask or Near wallets compliant with [NEP-413](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0413.md).
   - Sign a challenge from the node and submit the signature.
   - If the signature matches the challenge and the public key, the first node key is added, activating key management capabilities.

   -->

#### Client keys

Client keys are generated on login and used by the frontend. Stored in browser local storage, these keys initiate applications and server as permissioned access to the node.

**Client Key Usage**:

1. **Key Creation**: Users generate a new keypair in their browser.
2. **Verification**:
   - A Verifiable Presentation Request is sent to the node, which responds with a challenge.
   - The challenge and public key are signed using the root key.
   - Upon node verification of the request and signature, the new key is cleared for JSONRPC API communication from the browser to the node.

Calimero's TypeScript SDK supports developers in building browser and CLI applications by simplifying interaction with the network.

#### Runtime keys

Runtime keys are used for signing transactions within a context, with the appropriate key selected based on the context identity.

#### Encryption keys

Keys used for encrypting and decrypting messages between peers in the context. Each context has its own encryption key. More in [Learn - Encryption](./../advanced-concepts/encryption)
