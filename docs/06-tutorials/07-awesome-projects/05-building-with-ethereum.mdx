## Smart contract overview

### Contracts overview

Both contracts are written in Solidity, you can find their implementations in
the following repositories:

- [Context contract](https://github.com/calimero-network/contracts/tree/master/contracts/ethereum/context-config)
- [Proxy contract](https://github.com/calimero-network/contracts/tree/master/contracts/ethereum/context-proxy)

## Context and Proxy Contract

### Context contract

Context contract is deployed on Ethereum sepolia network and implemented into
Calimero. It is used to create and manage contexts and their members.

<lb />
More information about context contract can be found
[here](/core-concepts/blockchains-integration#context-contract).

### Proxy contract

With each context creation a proxy contract for that context is deployed. Proxy
contract is used to handle blockchain operations such as cross-contract calls
and transfers as well as storing variables.

<lb />
More information about proxy contract can be found
[here](/core-concepts/blockchains-integration#functionality-details).

## Setting up and configuring nodes

:::info

By deafult proposal needs 3 approvals before it is executed so we will setup 3
nodes.

:::

- Initialize and start 3 nodes
- Install
  [blockchain demo application](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations/tree/master/logic)
- Create context for blockchain demo application
- Invite all nodes in the same context

#### Initialize and Start Nodes

Open 3 terminals side by side.

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
merod --node-name node1 init --server-port 2427 --swarm-port 2527
```

```bash title="Node2 Terminal"
merod --node-name node2 init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
```

```bash title="Node3 Terminal"
merod --node-name node3 init --server-port 2429 --swarm-port 2529
```

The output should look like this:

<img src="/icp-tutorial/12_init_cali_nodes.png" alt="init-nodes" />
You can verify nodes initialization files by looking into `~/.calimero` folder.

:::note Self signer vs. Relayer signer

In `config.toml` file you can see default configuration:

```
[context.config.ethereum]
signer = "relayer"
protocol = "ethereum"
network = "sepolia"
contract_id = <CONFIG_CONTRACT_ID>
```

If you use `self` for signer then you also need to change `public` and `secret`
key.

```
[context.config.signer.self.ethereum.testnet]
rpc_url = <RPC_URL>
account_id = <YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>
secret_key = <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

The values auto-generated only represent the format needed for self signing
feature and are not real Ethereum accounts. To create your own Ethereum account
with CLI follow the Foundry
[Docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet-new)

:::

More on node initialization can be found [here](/running-a-node/setup/).

Now we are going to start the nodes with the commands:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
merod --node-name node1 run
```

```bash title="Node2 Terminal"
merod --node-name node2 run
```

```bash title="Node3 Terminal"
merod --node-name node3 run
```

After running the nodes you should see the similar to this one:

<img src="/icp-tutorial/14_start_cali_nodes.png" alt="running-nodes" />

#### Install application

Inside the node1 terminal we are going to install blockchain demo application.

1. Clone the
   [Demo Blockchain Integrations](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations)
   repository.
2. Navigate to the `logic` directory.
3. Build the application using the `build.sh` script, script will compile wasm
   file in /res directory.
4. Copy the `blockchain.wasm` file path

Applications are installed with the following command:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
application install file <PATH_TO_blockchain.wasm_FILE>
>Installed application: <APPLICATION_ID>
```

After installing the application we can create context:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
context create <APPLICATION_ID> --protocol ethereum
>Created context <CONTEXT_ID> with identity <CONTEXT_IDENTITY>
```

After creating context we need to add node2 and node3 to it.

<br /> To be able to do that we need to create identities for node2 and node3
with whom they will join to the created context.

```bash title="Node2 Terminal"
identity new
>> Private key: <PRIVATE_KEY>
>> Public key: <PUBLIC_KEY>
```

```bash title="Node3 Terminal"
identity new
>> Private key: <PRIVATE_KEY>
>> Public key: <PUBLIC_KEY>
```

The output should look like this:

<img src="/icp-tutorial/16_create_new_identity.png" alt="create-identity" />

After creating identities we can invite node2 and node3 to join the created
context.

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
context invite <CONTEXT_ID> <PUBLIC_KEY_OF_NODE2> --as <CONTEXT_IDENTITY>
>> Invitation payload: <INVITATION_PAYLOAD>
```

This will generate a invitation payload which can node2 use to join the context.
Copy the invitation payload and do the following command in node2 terminal:

```bash title="Node2 Terminal"
context join <PRIVATE_KEY_OF_NODE2> <INVITATION_PAYLOAD>
>> Joined context <CONTEXT_ID>
```

Repeat the same steps for Node3.

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
context invite <CONTEXT_ID> <PUBLIC_KEY_OF_NODE3> --as <CONTEXT_IDENTITY>
```

```bash title="Node3 Terminal"
context join <PRIVATE_KEY_OF_NODE3> <INVITATION_PAYLOAD>
>> Joined context <CONTEXT_ID>
```

The output in terminal after inviting and joining nodes should look like this:

<img src="/icp-tutorial/16_invite_nodes.png" alt="join-context" />

<br />

More on invitations and joining the context can be found
[here](https://calimero-network.github.io/tutorials/invitations-and-joinings)

Lastly we can check if all nodes are connected in context with:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
context ls
> <CONTEXT_ID>
```

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
identity ls <CONTEXT_ID>
```

<img src="/icp-tutorial/18_verify_context.png" alt="context-members" />

We can see there are 3 nodes connected in context.

#### Fund Proxy Contract

We have now installed the application and created context. To be able to fully
use proxy contract we need to fund it. To get proxy contract address we need to
use API GET call to retrieve it from the node.

The 3 running nodes are located on:

- https://localhost:2427
- https://localhost:2428
- https://localhost:2429.

Any of them can be queried to get the value of proxy contract id.

API endpoint to fetch proxy contract id is:
`http://localhost:2428/admin-api/contexts/CONTEXT_ID/proxy-contract`

> CONTEXT_ID can be copied from previous steps

And for our case it is:
`http://localhost:2428/admin-api/contexts/7krojDziAKRWP8KrUD8aYGL3z5peScNxPXaBWTKCFr2h/proxy-contract`

Example of request in postman:

<img
  src="/ethereum-tutorial/proxy_contract_ethereum.png"
  alt="proxy-contract"
/>

Now you can fund the proxy contract by using the following command:

```bash
cast send \
  --value 1eth \
  --private-key <YOUR_SECRET_KEY> \
  <PROXY_CONTRACT_ID>
```

Where:

- `<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>` is the account from which to transfer the funds.
- `<PROXY_CONTRACT_ID>` is the address of the proxy contract you want to fund.
- `1eth` is the amount of eth you want to fund the contract with.

For more information about transferring funds checkout this
[link](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) To verify contract
balance you can check it on Etherscan Explorer by visiting:

`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/<PROXY_CONTRACT_ID>`

## Blockchain Demo Application

This application is used to demonstrate how to interact with Calimero Proxy
contract through creating, approving and executing proposals.

The proxy contract supports the following types of proposals:

- **External function call** - Enables cross-contract call execution.
- **Transfer** - Allows transferring funds.
- **Set approval threshold** - Specifies the number of approvals required for
  proposal execution.
- **Set active proposal limit** - Defines the maximum number of active
  proposals.
- **Set context variables** - Allows setting key-value pairs for context
  variables.

While the demo focuses on specific functionality, you can customize the
application to suit your needs. Instead of building a complete frontend, this
demo serves as a foundation that you can extend to create a fully-featured
frontend application tailored to your requirements.

Navigate to frontend directory and install dependencies.

```bash title="Terminal"
cd demo-blockchain-integrations/app && pnpm install
```

Since we have 3 nodes we will need to setup frontend for each of them. Open 3
terminals side by side and run the following commands in each of them from /app
directory:

```bash title="Terminal 1 | Terminal 2 | Terminal 3"
pnpm run dev
```

After running the frontend you should see the following output in each of the
terminals:

<img src="/icp-tutorial/Demo_blockchain_app_start.png" alt="frontend-running" />

Open the applications in by clicking on the link in each of the terminals and
you will see form with input fields for node URL and application ID.

To get application ID you can use following command from any of node terminals:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
application ls
> <APPLICATION_ID>
```

The node URL of the nodes are respectively:

- http://localhost:2427
- http://localhost:2428
- http://localhost:2429

After submitting the form you will be redirected to admin dashboard where you
will see the login page with wallet selector.

<lb />
Select a wallet you wish to login with and afterwards you will be prompted to
select the context and context identity you wish to use.
<lb />
After selecting both you will be logged in and automatically redirected to the
application.

### Change Approval Threshold Proposal

First we are going to create an approval threshold change proposal so future
proposals can be executed by only 1 node. As mentioned earlier each proposal by
default needs 3 approvals to be executed.

1. Click on "Create Proposal" button and select "Change number of approvals
   needed" from dropdown.
2. In the input field set the number of approvals to 1 (this means that proposal
   will be executed on creation).
3. Click on "Create Proposal" button to create the proposal.

After proposal is created you will get the alert that proposal is created and it
will be shown in other frontend applications by selecting it in select field.

After selecting proposal on other frontend applications (node2 and node3) you
can see that it is created and can be approved by clicking on "Approve Proposal"
button.

### Cross-Contract Call Proposal

At this point proposal approval threshold is 1, meaning proposal will be
executed on creation. This means when we create cross-contract call proposal it
will instantly be executed.

We have created a `<DEMO_EXTERNAL_CONTRACT_ID>` and deployed it on Ethereum
sepolia.

Its address is:

```
0x2c42DADf80b1a76Db4038027D7DB24863a9d0d5D
```

It contains following methods:

- **setValueNoDeposit** - This method does not require a deposit for execution,
  it sets sent arguments in its storage.
- **deposit** - This method requires a deposit for execution, it first transfers
  the funds to the contract from proxy contract and then sets sent arguments in
  its storage, if the transfer is completed successfully.
- **getValue** - This method returns all calls stored in the contract.

You can see the contract itself and its implementation
[here](https://github.com/calimero-network/calimero-evm-contracts/tree/master/context-proxy/mock).

When creating cross-contract call proposal we need to provide following values:

- **Contract ID**: `{DEMO_EXTERNAL_CONTRACT_ID}` - Address of the external
  contract
- **Method Name**: `deposit(string, string)` - Name of the contract method that
  will be called with arguments types
- **Deposit**: 10000000 - Deposit for transfer in WEI (10¹⁸ WEI = 1 ETH)
- **Arguments**: The following arguments correspond to the deposit method
  parameters:

  | Type   | Value     |
  | ------ | --------- |
  | string | testKEY   |
  | string | testVALUE |

<img
  src="/stellar-tutorial/stellar_proposal_deposit_call.png"
  alt="create-ccc"
  style={{ width: '50%' }}
/>

Supported Ethereum argument types:

- `bool` - Boolean value, representing true or false.
- `string` - Text string, used for storing sequences of characters.
- `address` - Contract or account address, a 20-byte value used to identify
  accounts.
- `bytes` - Byte array, used for arbitrary-length binary data.
- `int256` - 256-bit signed integer, used for storing large integer values.
- `uint256` - 256-bit unsigned integer, used for storing large non-negative
  integer values.
- `array(bool)` - Array of boolean values.
- `array(string)` - Array of strings.
- `array(address)` - Array of addresses.
- `array(bytes)` - Array of byte arrays.
- `array(int256)` - Array of 256-bit signed integers.
- `array(uint256)` - Array of 256-bit unsigned integers.
- `tuple` - A fixed-size collection of values, which can be of different types.

These types are used to define the parameters and return values of smart
contract functions in Ethereum-based blockchains.

After we create proposal it will be executed, and the success of the execution
can be checked calling demo external contract method **get_value** with Forge
CLI:

```bash
cast call \
  <DEMO_EXTERNAL_CONTRACT_ID> \
  "getValue(string)" \
  "testKEY"
```

To check if transfer was successful we can use Etherscan Explorer by visiting:

`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/<DEMO_EXTERNAL_CONTRACT_ID>`

There you will see the current funds attached to the contract.

:::caution

The implementation of cross-contract call with deposit is based on the following
steps:

1. The contract detects that an attached deposit is present.
2. It calls the ledger contract to enable the external contract (the contract
   being called) to withdraw funds.
3. The external contract is called, and it must contain logic to withdraw the
   funds that have been allocated for it in the ledger contract.
4. After the cross-contract call is completed, the proxy contract sets the
   allowance back to 0 to ensure security.
