## Requirements

To follow this tutorial, you'll need to clone the following Calimero
repositories:

- Calimero Core - [Repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/core)
- Demo Blockchain Integrations -
  [Repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations)
- ICP Demo Contract -
  [Repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/icp-demo-contract)

You also need following tools:

- **Cargo**: Version `1.86.0-nightly` used for tutorial -
  [url](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **DFX** (Dfinity SDK): Version `0.24.3` used for tutorial -

## Starting a Local Devnet

Script for local devnet is located in Calimero Core repository. First clone the
[repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/core) and navigate to directory
`core/contracts/icp/context-config/`.

:::caution

Script is implemented in a way that it deletes current dfx enviroment and
creates new one. This will delete all previous setups and deployed smart
contracts.

:::

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/core
```

```bash title="Terminal"
cd core/contracts/icp/context/config/
```

Give permissions and Run the deploy devnet script:

```bash title="Terminal"
chmod +x ./deploy_devnet.sh && ./deploy_devnet.sh
```

If you are missing any of the required tools the script will exit and tell you
what tool is missing.

<details>
  <summary>Running the script should look like the following image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/1_start_devnet_script.png" alt="devnetsript" />
  </p>
</details>

When the script finished you should get the following output.

```bash title="Terminal"
=== Deployment Summary ===
Context Contract ID: bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
Ledger Contract ID: bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai

```

<details>
  <summary>Sucessfull deployment image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/2_devnet_script_finish.png"
      alt="FinishDevnetScript"
    />
  </p>
</details>

Save this information because you will need some values in later steps.

You can also ping the devnet to verify its running with the command:

```bash title="Terminal"
dfx ping
```

<details>
  <summary>Ping response image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/3_ping_devnet.png" alt="pingresponse" />
  </p>
</details>

At this point the ICP devnet is running and we can now deploy our smart
contracts.

## Greet Smart Contract for ICP

### Greet Smart Contract

Greet smart contract has only two methods set_greet and get_greet.

- ICP Query method **get_greet** - returns greeting which is "Hello, world!" in
  default case.
- ICP Update method **set_greet** - has one paremeter which is args_bytes which
  is `"name":"value"` in JSON.

at the end of the contract we have `ic_cdk::export_candid!()` which is used to
generate .did file from this contract.

<details>
  <summary>Greet smart contract source code image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/contract_greet.png" alt="greet-source-code" />
  </p>
</details>

### Clone Repository

Now lets clone the ICP Demo Contract
[repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/icp-demo-contract) and navigate
to cloned repository.

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/icp-demo-contract
```

```bash title="Terminal"
cd icp-demo-contract
```

### Build Smart Contract

Now lets first build our contract to get .wasm file from the contract.

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown –release
```

<details>
  <summary>Build output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/4_cargo_build.png" alt="cargo-build" />
  </p>
</details>

After build command finishes you should have `greet.wasm` file inside the
`target` folder.

<details>
  <summary>Greet .wasm file image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/5_cargo_wasm.png" alt="wasm-file" />
  </p>
</details>

### Generate Greet .did file

This command extracts the Candid interface (a .did file) from the compiled
WebAssembly (.wasm) binary of the greet smart contract and saves it to
`src/greet/greet.did`.

```bash title="Terminal"
candid-extractor target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/greet.wasm > src/greet/greet.did
```

<details>
  <summary>Terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/6_candid_extractor.png" alt="candid-extractor" />
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Greet .did file image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/7_greet_did_file.png" alt="did-file" />
  </p>
</details>

### Deploy Smart Contract

Navigate to `src/greet` and run following command to create canister and deploy
contract.

```bash title="Terminal"
cd src/greet
```

```bash title="Terminal"
dfx canister create greet && dfx deploy
```

<details>
  <summary>Deploy terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/8_greet_deploy.png" alt="deploy-terminal-output" />
    > <br />> Save the `canister ID` as you > will need it later to call its
    query and mutate methods. > > In this case the canister ID is:
    `br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai`
  </p>
</details>

### Test Smart Contract

Smart contract has been deployed on the ICP devnet and now we can test its
methods. Through terminal we are going to test the get_greet query method with
the following commands.

```bash title="ICP Demo Contract Repository Terminal"
dfx canister call greet get_greet
>("Hello, world!")
```

<details>
  <summary>Query terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/9_test_query.png" alt="query-terminal-output" />
  </p>
</details>

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx canister call br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai get_greet
>("Hello, world!")
```

<details>
  <summary>Query terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/10_test_query_core.png"
      alt="query-terminal-output"
    />
  </p>
</details>

## Context and Proxy Contract

At this point we have ICP devnet running and Greet smart contract deployed.

Now we need to seed the context contract and fund proxy contracts in order to
make cross-contract calls possible.

### Seed Context Contract

To seed context contract use following commands inside the Calimero Core
repository terminal.

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx identity use default
>Using identity: "default".
```

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx identity get-wallet
>bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai
```

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx ledger fabricate-cycles --canister bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai --amount 200000
>At the current exchange rate, 20000000000000 e8s produces approximately 1514100000000000000 cycles.
>Fabricating 1514100000000000000 cycles onto bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai
>Fabricated 1514100000000000000 cycles, updated balance: 1_969_490_699_199_715_097 cycles
```

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx canister id context_contract
>bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
```

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx canister deposit-cycles 1000000000000000000 bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
>Depositing 1000000000000000000 cycles onto bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
>Deposited 1000000000000000000 cycles, updated balance: >2_000_003_061_071_811_962 cycles
```

<details>
  <summary>Seed contract terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/11_fund_context_contract.png" alt="seed-contract" />
  </p>
</details>

Now context contract has cycles deposited and we need to fund the proxy
contract.

### Fund Proxy Contract

In order to fund proxy contract we must first create a context within a node.
Proxy contract gets deployed from context contract in the process of context
cration.

For this tutorial we are going to:

- create 3 nodes with ICP set as default protocol.
- install
  [blockchain demo application](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations/tree/master/logic)
- create context for blockchain demo application
- invite all nodes in the same context

Detailed explanation for:

- installing application can be found [here](/tutorials/install-application).
- creating context can be found [here](/tutorials/create-context).
- context invitation and join can be found
  [here](/tutorials/invitations-and-joinings)

After we finish previous steps we will be able to continue with funding the
proxy contract.

#### Initialize and Start Nodes

As mentioned we are going to create 3 nodes with following commands.

```bash title="Terminal 1"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528 --protocol icp
```

```bash title="Terminal 2"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node2 init --server-port 2427 --swarm-port 2527 --protocol icp
```

```bash title="Terminal 3"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node3 init --server-port 2429 --swarm-port 2529 --protocol icp
```

<details>
  <summary>Node initialization terminal image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/12_init_cali_nodes.png" alt="init-nodes" />
  </p>
</details>

You can verify nodes configuration by looking into `~.calimero` folder.

<details>
  <summary>Nodes configuration image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/13_verify_node_config.png"
      alt="nodes-configuration"
    />
    > <br />> We can see that protocol is `ICP` and network is `local`.
  </p>
</details>

More on node initialization can be found [here](/getting-started/setup/).

Now we are going to start the nodes with the commands:

```bash title="Terminal 1"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 run
```

```bash title="Terminal 2"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node2 run
```

```bash title="Terminal 3"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node3 run
```

<details>
  <summary>Running nodes terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/14_start_cali_nodes.png" alt="running-nodes" />
  </p>
</details>

#### Install application

Inside the node1 terminal we are going to install blockchain demo application.

For that we are going to need the application .wasm file which can be created by
using
[this](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations/blob/master/logic/build.sh)
script in the Demo Blockchain Integrations repository.

At the time of creating this tutorial `blockchain.wasm` is located in core
repository on following path `core/apps/blockchain/blockchain.wasm`.

Applications are installed with the following:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
application install file /Users/frandomovic/Desktop/job/core/apps/blockchain/res/blockchain.wasm
>Application installed <APPLICATION_ID>
```

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
context create <APPLICATION_ID>
>Created context <CONTEXT_ID> with identity <CONTEXT_IDENTITY>
```

<details>
  <summary>
    Application install and create context terminal output image
  </summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/16_2_node_1_install_app.png" alt="install-app" />
  </p>
</details>

From node2 and node3 terminal we are going to create a new identity which will
be used for context invitation.

```bash title="Node2 Terminal"
identity new
>> Private key: <PRIVATE_KEY>
>> Public key: <PUBLIC_KEY>
```

```bash title="Node3 Terminal"
identity new
>> Private key: <PRIVATE_KEY>
>> Public key: <PUBLIC_KEY>
```

<details>
  <summary>Create identity terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/16_create_new_identity.png" alt="create-identity" />
  </p>
</details>

Now we are going to do the process of invitation where from node1 we invite
node2 and node3 inside the previously created context.

<details>
  <summary>Joining context terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/16_invite_nodes.png" alt="join-context" />
  </p>
</details>
> > More on invitations and joining the context can be found >
[here](https://calimero-network.github.io/tutorials/invitations-and-joinings)

Lastly we can check if all nodes are connected in context with:

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
context ls
> <CONTEXT_ID>
```

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
identity ls <CONTEXT_ID>
```

<details>
  <summary>View context members terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/18_verify_context.png" alt="context-members" />
  </p>
</details>

We can see there are 3 nodes connected in context.

#### Fund Proxy Contract

Now we finished the part with application installation, context creation and
invitation. We can get back to funding the proxy contract.

To get proxy contract we need to use API GET call for any of the running nodes.

The 3 running nodes are located on:

- https://localhost:2427
- https://localhost:2428
- https://localhost:2429.

Any of them can be queried to get the value of proxy contract id.

API endpoint to fetch proxy contract id is:
`http://localhost:2428/admin-api/contexts/CONTEXT_ID/proxy-contract`

> CONTEXT_ID can be copied from previous steps

And for our case it is:
`http://localhost:2428/admin-api/contexts/7krojDziAKRWP8KrUD8aYGL3z5peScNxPXaBWTKCFr2h/proxy-contract`

<details>
  <summary>Postman GET request output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/19_get_proxy_contract.png" alt="context-members" />
    > <br />> We get value of > proxy contract id which is:
    `b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai`
  </p>
</details>

Now when we have the proxy contract lets go back to Core repository terminal and
fund the contract.

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx identity use initial
>Using identity: "initial".
```

To fund the contract we are going to use command:

```bash
dfx canister call <LEDGER_CONTRACT_ID> icrc1_transfer "(record { to = record { owner = principal \"<PROXY_CONTRACT_ID> \"; subaccount = null}; amount = 1_000_000_000; fee = null; memo = null; from_subaccount = null; created_at_time = null})"
```

> LEDGER_CONTRACT_ID - this value can be viewed when ./deploy_devnet.sh script
> finishes. In our case value is: `bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai`
>
> PROXY_CONTRACT_ID - value we got in previous step. In our case value is:
> `b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai`

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx canister call bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai icrc1_transfer "(record { to = record { owner = principal \"b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai"\"; subaccount = null}; amount = 1_000_000_000; fee = null; memo = null; from_subaccount = null; created_at_time = null})"
> (variant { Ok = 1 : nat })
```

<details>
  <summary>Fund contract terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/20_fund_proxy_contract.png" alt="fund-contract" />
  </p>
</details>

And verify the contract balance:

```bash title="Calimero Core Repository Terminal"
dfx canister call bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai icrc1_balance_of "(record { owner = principal \"b77ix-eeaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai\"; subaccount = null })"
> (1_000_000_000 : nat)
```

<details>
  <summary>Verify balance terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/21_verify_balance.png" alt="verify-balance" />
  </p>
</details>

## Blockchain Demo Application

We will now clone the Blockchain Demo Application
[Repository](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations)
and run the application.

This demo application allows us to create proposals, which are essential for
executing cross-contract calls. Each created proposal requires minimum of 3
approvals before a proposal is executed thats why in this tutorial we will be
using 3 nodes for the first step.

For this tutorial, we will perform a set_greet cross-contract call directly from
the node.

At this stage, everything is set up, so let’s proceed by cloning the blockchain
demo integrations repository and running the application.

> While the demo focuses on specific functionality, you can customize the
> application to suit your needs. Instead of building a complete frontend, this
> demo serves as a foundation that you can extend to create a fully-featured
> frontend application tailored to your requirements.

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations && cd demo-blockchain-integrations/app && pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

<details>
  <summary>Terminal output for started application image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/23_start_blockchain_demo_app.png"
      alt="running-demo-app"
    />
  </p>
</details>

For this application we will also need application ID which can be copied from
any of previous steps or use following command from any of node terminals.

```bash title="Node1 Terminal"
application ls
> <APPLICATION_ID>
```

<details>
  <summary>Get application id terminal output image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/22_get_app_id.png" alt="get-app-id" />
  </p>
</details>

Open web application on given URL and go through the setup, copy application ID
and enter the node URL. We will do this process for all 3 nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Blockchain demo application setup for node1 image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/23_login_node1.png" alt="setup-app" />
  </p>
</details>

After you login you should see the Blockchain Demo Application

<details>
  <summary>Blockchain demo application image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/24_create_threshold_proposal.png" alt="demo-app" />
  </p>
</details>

### Change Approval Threshold Proposal

First we are going to create an approval threshold change proposal so future
proposals can be executed by only 1 node. As mentioned earlier each proposal by
default needs 3 approvals to be executed.

<details>
  <summary>Create proposal image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/25_proposal_creation.png" alt="create-proposal" />
  </p>
</details>

We get a popup saying proposal was created.

<details>
  <summary>Proposal created popup image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/26_proposal_popup_1.png"
      alt="create-proposal-popup"
    />
  </p>
</details>

And we can see the proposal, it has only 1 approver on creation.

<details>
  <summary>Proposal overview image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/27_proposal_overview.png" alt="proposal-overview" />
  </p>
</details>

Press `Logout` button and to the same steps but with setup for node2.

<details>
  <summary>Blockchain demo application setup for node2 image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/28_login_node2.png" alt="node2-setup" />
  </p>
</details>

Approve proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Approved proposal overview image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/29_approve_node2.png" alt="approve-proposal" />
  </p>
</details>

Proposal approved popup.

<details>
  <summary>Proposal approved popup image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/30_proposal_popup_2.png"
      alt="approve-proposal-popup"
    />
  </p>
</details>

Now the same steps with the node3.

<details>
  <summary>Blockchain demo application setup for node3 image</summary>
  <p>
    <img src="/icp-tutorial/31_login_node3.png" alt="node3-setup" />
  </p>
</details>

Approve proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Proposal approved popup image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/30_proposal_popup_2.png"
      alt="approve-proposal-popup"
    />
  </p>
</details>

And after third proposal approval we get popup saying proposal was executed.

<details>
  <summary>Proposal executed popup image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/32_execute_proposal_node3.png"
      alt="execute-proposal-popup"
    />
  </p>
</details>

### Cross-Contract Call Proposal

At this point proposal approval threshold is 1, meaning proposal will be
executed on creation. This means when we create cross-contract call proposal it
will insantly be executed.

So lets create a cross-contract call proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Create cross-contract call proposal image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/33_create_cross_call_proposal.png"
      alt="create-ccc"
    />
  </p>
</details>

Values for this form can be found in previous steps and for our case they are:

- **Contract ID**: br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai
- **Method Name**: set_greet (defined in .did file form previous steps)
- **Deposit**: 0
- **Arguments**: for this smart contract we will be using "name" as key and
  "calimero" as value.

After we create proposal it will be executed.

<details>
  <summary>Proposal executed popup image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/34_proposal_popup_3.png"
      alt="proposal-executed-popup"
    />
  </p>
</details>

And now for the last step we can run get_greet method from beggining to see if
greet changed.

<details>
  <summary>Terminal ouput for get_greet method image</summary>
  <p>
    <img
      src="/icp-tutorial/35_verify_change_method.png"
      alt="get-greet-image"
    />
  </p>
</details>

> We can see in terminal the first time we used command output was: Hello,
> world! And after proposal was executed greet was changed to: Hello, calimero!
