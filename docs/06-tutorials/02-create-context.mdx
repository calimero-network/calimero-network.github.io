## Create a context using the Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to the "Contexts" tab and click the "Start New Context" button.
2. Use the "Browse" button to select an application from the list.
3. Choose the "Template Application" option.
4. Press "Start" to initiate the context creation process with the selected
   application.

Visit [Admin Dashboard Page](../../developer-tools/apps/admin-dashboard) to view
detailed instructions with images.

After the context is created, you will be redirected to the context dashboard.
Keep this page open as you will need the Context ID later.

## Create context using interactive CLI

After you have start the node following
[instructions](../../getting-started/setup), interactive CLI will be available
within the same terminal.

> **NOTE**: You can see available commands in terminal: call, peers, pool, gc,
> context, application. In this example we will be using commands for `context`
> and `application`.

### Step 1: Install the Application

Run the following command to install the application:

```bash
application install url {url} {metadata}
```

> **NOTE**: metadata example:

```bash
'{"contractAppId": "<application_id>"}'
```

You can find the application `URL` and `contractAppId` by opening Application
Details from Applications section of the Admin Dashboard.

You can also install an app that you have available locally with `file`:

```bash
application install file {path/to/file}
```

`contractApplicationId` is the id of application stored in the contract. Value
is optional but if provided, it enables Admin Dashboard to extract and display
the application metadata.

```bash title="Example"
application install url https://blobby-public.euw3.prod.gcp.calimero.network/bafkreihl5o6etrnpy7dlgixz3onbfb3og4dll2yqsqaebqakuldk6e2qya '{"contractAppId": "980265ba072119a9074e429dea477e1c084a94e8d9f645c0158680e6942fb99e"}'

### Step 2: Create a New Context

Conext can be created from the
[Admin Dashboard Page](../../developer-tools/apps/admin-dashboard) or with
interactive CLI.

After the application is successfully installed, you can create a new context
with the installed application using this command:

```bash
context create {applicationId}
```

```bash title="Example"
context create Ahe2vLWLgswJARv5LsafXp7uJyb2Ba9GjzUSeLc71gUF
