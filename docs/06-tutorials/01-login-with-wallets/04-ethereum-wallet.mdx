## Logging in with Ethereum Wallet

Calimero allows users to authenticate via their Ethereum wallet (such as
Metamask), ensuring secure access to the Admin Dashboard. The process of logging
in with an Ethereum wallet involves the following steps:

### 1. User Initiates Login

- The user navigates to the Admin Dashboard and selects the option to "Login
  with Ethereum Wallet."
- They are presented with wallet options, typically Metamask or other Web3
  wallet extensions.

### 2. Wallet Connection

- The user connects their Ethereum wallet (e.g., Metamask) to the Calimero
  application.
- The wallet extension prompts the user to approve the connection and select the
  desired account.
- The user's Ethereum address is retrieved from the connected wallet.

### 3. Server Issues Challenge

- Upon successful wallet connection, the server generates a challenge message.
- This challenge is presented to the user for signing through their Ethereum
  wallet.

### 4. User Signs Challenge

- The user is prompted to sign the server-issued challenge using their Ethereum
  wallet.
- The wallet extension displays the message to be signed and requests user
  confirmation.
- The user approves the signature request in their wallet.

### 5. Signature Verification

The backend verifies the Ethereum signature to ensure its authenticity using
Ethereum's cryptographic standards:

1. **Message Hash Verification**:

   - The original challenge message is hashed using Ethereum's standard hashing
     algorithm.
   - The signature is verified against the message hash and the user's public
     key.

2. **Ethereum Address Recovery**:
   - The user's Ethereum address is recovered from the signature.
   - This address serves as the user's unique identifier for authentication.

### 6. Successful Login

- Once verified, the user is successfully logged into the Admin Dashboard.
- Their Ethereum address becomes their Decentralized Identifier (DID), enabling
  decentralized authentication across different contexts and applications.

## Supported Ethereum Wallets

Calimero supports various Ethereum-compatible wallets:

- **Metamask**: The most popular Web3 wallet extension
- **WalletConnect**: For mobile wallet connections
- **Other Web3 Wallets**: Any wallet that supports the standard Ethereum signing
  interface

## Network Support

Ethereum wallet authentication works across multiple Ethereum networks:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Production network
- **Ethereum Testnets**: Sepolia, Goerli, and other test networks
- **Ethereum Layer 2s**: Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and other L2 solutions
- **Ethereum-compatible chains**: BSC, Avalanche C-Chain, and other
  EVM-compatible networks

## Security Features

- **Nonce-based Challenges**: Each login attempt uses a unique challenge to
  prevent replay attacks
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All signatures are verified using Ethereum's
  standard cryptographic methods
- **Address-based Identity**: User identity is tied to their Ethereum address,
  ensuring decentralized authentication

This login flow ensures a secure and seamless authentication process leveraging
Ethereum's robust blockchain-based security and the widespread adoption of Web3
wallets.
