## Logging in with Ethereum Wallet

Calimero allows users to authenticate via their Ethereum wallet (such as
Metamask), ensuring secure access to the Admin Dashboard. The authentication
process leverages Ethereum's ECDSA signature verification through the
authentication service.

## Authentication Flow

The Ethereum authentication in Calimero follows the same challenge-response
pattern as other supported wallets. Here's how it works:

### 1. User Initiates Login

- The user initiates login and is redirected to the authentication page
- They are presented with wallet options, typically Metamask for Ethereum
  authentication

### 2. Server Issues Authentication Challenge

- The authentication service generates a unique challenge for the user to sign
- This challenge typically includes a timestamp and unique identifier to prevent
  replay attacks

### 3. User Signs Authentication Challenge

- The user is prompted to sign the server-issued structured challenge using
  their Ethereum wallet.
- The wallet extension displays the challenge data and requests user
  confirmation.
- The user approves the signature request in their wallet.

### 4. Signature Sent to Backend

- After the user signs the challenge, the signature is sent back to the server
  for verification.

### 5. Signature Verification

- The backend verifies the Ethereum signature to ensure its authenticity using
  standard ECDSA signature verification.
- The signature is verified against the structured challenge that was signed.
- If the signature is valid, the user's Ethereum address is extracted and stored
  as the user's unique identifier.

### 6. Successful Authentication

- Once verified, the user is successfully authenticated.
- The user's identifier is the wallet's public key.

## Authentication Implementation

Calimero's Ethereum authentication uses structured challenges with ECDSA
signature verification:

- **Structured Challenge Generation**: The server generates a unique structured
  challenge for each login attempt using the Request format
- **Signature Verification**: The backend verifies the ECDSA signature against
  the structured challenge
- **Identity Storage**: The user's Ethereum wallet public key serves as their
  unique identifier

## Supported Ethereum Wallets

Calimero supports MetaMask for Ethereum authentication:

- **Metamask**: The most popular Web3 wallet extension

## Security Features

- **Structured Challenge-Response Authentication**: Each login attempt uses a
  unique server-generated structured challenge with specific fields for enhanced
  security
- **ECDSA Signature Verification**: Uses Ethereum's standard cryptographic
  methods for signature validation
- **Public Key-based Identity**: User identity is tied to their Ethereum wallet
  public key, ensuring decentralized authentication
- **Standard Wallet Security**: Leverages the security features of established
  Ethereum wallets like Metamask

This authentication flow leverages Ethereum's robust ECDSA signature
verification to provide secure, decentralized access to Calimero's features
while maintaining consistency with the blockchain's native security model.
