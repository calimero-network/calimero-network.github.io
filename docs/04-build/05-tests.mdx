# Running tests

Before running the test script, ensure it has the proper execution permissions.
You can do this by using the chmod command, which changes file permissions in
Unix-based systems.

```bash title="Terminal"
chmod +x ./scripts/test.sh
```

After granting the necessary permissions, you can execute the test script.

```bash title="Terminal"
./scripts/test.sh
```
