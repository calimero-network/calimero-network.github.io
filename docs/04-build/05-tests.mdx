# Run tests

We have script for running tests which prepares environment and runs tests.
Script can either run all tests or only tests that are affected by changes in
files.

Run all tests

```bash title="Terminal"
./scripts/test.sh --all
```

Run tests in crates defind by changed files and tests in crates that are using
those files. `changed_files` list contains file paths divided by space.

```bash title="Terminal"
./scripts/test.sh --local {changed_files}
```
