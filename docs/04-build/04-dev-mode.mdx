# Using Dev Mode in meroctl CLI

## Overview

The meroctl CLI provides a powerful feature called "dev mode" that allows
developers to test their applications locally before publishing them to the
network. This mode is particularly useful during the development and testing
phases of your application.

All of the communication with your node through the meroctl CLI is protected by
your nodes private key.

## Why Use Dev Mode?

Dev mode offers several advantages:

1. **Local Testing**: Test your application on your local machine without
   needing to publish it to the network.
2. **Quick Iterations**: Make changes to your application and immediately test
   them without going through the full publication process.
3. **Context Creation**: Automatically create a context and link it to your
   local application.
4. **Hot Reload-like Functionality**: Any changes to the binary will
   automatically reflect in the context, eliminating the need to "upload" the
   app again after every change.

## Prerequisites

Before using dev mode, ensure you have a node running. This should be done in a
separate terminal window. For more information, see the
[Setup guide](/getting-started/setup).

## How to Use Dev Mode

To list all supported commands for the deamon, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p merod -- help
```

To list all supported commands for the cli, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- help
```

Supported commands:

- `context` Manage contexts
- `app` Manage applications
- `help` Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Here's the basic syntax:

All commands share the same prefix:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home <path_to_home> --node-name <node_name> <command>
```

### Parameters:

- `--home`: Specifies the path to the home directory. ( In our example we are
  using `data` as the home directory)
- `--node-name`: Specifies the name of the node.

- `--path`: Specifies the absolute path to your WASM file.

Create dev context using installed app

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home <path_to_home> --node-name <node_name> context create --watch <path>
```

Output

```bash title="Terminal"
$ cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context create  --watch ./path/to/binary.wasm
Application `<appId>` installed!
Context `<contextId>` created!
Context{contextId} -> Application{appId}
(i) Watching for changes to "./path/to/binary.wasm"
```

Invite other local nodes to participate in the context

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p  meroctl -- --node-name node2 --home data  context join --context-id contextId
```

Output

```bash title="Terminal"
Context <contextId> sucesfully joined
```

Create context command will:

1. Install your application locally.
2. Create a new context.
3. Link the context to your local application.

### Automatic Updates

One of the key benefits of dev mode is its ability to automatically reflect
changes in your application. When you modify and recompile your WASM binary,
these changes are immediately available in the context without requiring you to
"upload" or reinstall the application. This feature provides a seamless
development experience, similar to "hot reload" functionality in other
development environments.

### Other useful commands

1. List existing contexts

```bash title="Terminal"
$ cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context ls
```

2. Create a context for a published application:

```bash title="Terminal"
$ cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context create --application-id <appId>
```

Output

```bash title="Terminal"
Context `contextId` created!
Context{contextId} -> Application{appId}
```

3. Update applications in a context

```bash title="Terminal"
# Update with a published application ID
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context update --context-id <context-id> -a <application-id> --as <identity>

# Update with a local application file (one-time)
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context update --context-id <context-id> --path ./path/to/file --as <identity>

# Update with a local application file (watch mode / reccuring updates)
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context update --context-id <context-id> --path ./path/to/file --watch --as <identity>
```

The update command allows you to:

- Update a context to use a different published application
- Install and update to a local application file
- Watch a local application file for changes and automatically update the contex

### From development to Publication

When you're ready to move from local development to publishing your application:

1. Test your application thoroughly using dev mode.

2. When satisfied with your application's performance, follow the steps in the
   Publish App guide to publish your application to the network.

3. After publication, you can create contexts for your published application
   using the --application-id flag instead of dev mode.

Install the local app on node for debugging

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home <path_to_home> --node-name <node_name> app install â€“-path <path>
```

Output

```bash title="Terminal"
Application installed successfully. Application ID: <appId>
```
