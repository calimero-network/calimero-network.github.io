# Using Dev Mode in meroctl CLI

## Overview

The meroctl CLI provides a powerful feature called "dev mode" that allows
developers to test their applications locally before publishing them to the
network. This mode is particularly useful during the development and testing
phases of your application.

## Why Use Dev Mode?

Dev mode offers several advantages:

1. **Local Testing**: Test your application on your local machine without
   needing to publish it to the network.
2. **Quick Iterations**: Make changes to your application and immediately test
   them without going through the full publication process.
3. **Context Creation**: Automatically create a context and link it to your
   local application.
4. **Hot Reload-like Functionality**: Any changes to the binary will
   automatically reflect in the context, eliminating the need to "upload" the
   app again after every change.

## Prerequisites

Before using dev mode, ensure you have a node and a coordinator node running. This should be done in a
separate terminal window.

## How to Use Dev Mode

To use dev mode, you'll use the `context create` command with the `--dev` flag.
Here's the basic syntax:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- --home <path_to_home> --node-name <node_name> context create --dev --path <path_to_wasm_file> --version <version_number>
```

### Parameters:

- `--home`: Specifies the path to the home directory.
- `--node-name`: Specifies the name of the node.
- `--dev`: Enables dev mode.
- `--path`: Specifies the path to your WASM file.
- `--version`: Specifies the version of your application (optional).

## Example Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
$ cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context create --dev --path ./path/to/binary.wasm --version 1.0.0
Created BTgDJ5FezfFJCMWzRWScXiwkgfMHX3zX4s3Qum7Gf4pb linked to application ./path/to/binary.wasm
```

This command will:

1. Install your application locally.
2. Create a new context.
3. Link the context to your local application.

### Automatic Updates

One of the key benefits of dev mode is its ability to automatically reflect
changes in your application. When you modify and recompile your WASM binary,
these changes are immediately available in the context without requiring you to
"upload" or reinstall the application. This feature provides a seamless
development experience, similar to "hot reload" functionality in other
development environments.

### Other useful commands

1. List existing contexts

```bash title="Terminal"
$ cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context ls
```

2. Create a context for a published application:

```bash title="Terminal"
$ cargo run -p meroctl -- --home data --node-name node1 context create --application-id APwGT9wuLwjkBoGxRR9thpS89VsbazYd6CpMpyqx4b5J
Created BTgDJ5FezfFJCMWzRWScXiwkgfMHX3zX4s3Qum7Gf4pb with application APwGT9wuLwjkBoGxRR9thpS89VsbazYd6CpMpyqx4b5J
```

### From development to Publication

When you're ready to move from local development to publishing your application:

1. Test your application thoroughly using dev mode.

2. When satisfied with your application's performance, follow the steps in the
   Publish App guide to publish your application to the network.

3. After publication, you can create contexts for your published application
   using the --application-id flag instead of dev mode.
