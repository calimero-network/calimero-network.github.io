## Getting Started with Calimero SDK for Rust

The Calimero SDK for Rust empowers developers to build applications that compile
to WebAssembly (Wasm) and run securely within the Calimero virtual machine (VM).
This guide will walk you through setting up a Rust project using the Calimero
SDK, writing an application, and preparing it for deployment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, follow
the official Rust installation guide for your platform:
[Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You should ensure you have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed. Run
the following command in your terminal to install the target:

```bash title="Terminal"
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Setting Up Your Project

To create a new project, initialize a Rust library project using Cargo. Run the
following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo new --lib kv-store
```

You should have a tree that looks like this:

```bash title="Terminal"
$ tree kv-store
kv-store
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs

2 directories, 2 files
```

At this point, we can `cd` into the `kv-store` directory:

```bash title="Terminal"
cd kv-store
```

Next, you need to specify the crate-type as `cdylib` in your `Cargo.toml` file
to generate a dynamic library that can be compiled to Wasm:

```toml title="File: Cargo.toml"
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

You can now configure your project to use the Calimero SDK by adding it as a
dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml title="File: Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
calimero-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/calimero-network/core" }
calimero-storage = { git = "https://github.com/calimero-network/core" }
```

Then, we need to specify a custom build profile for the most compact Wasm
output:

```toml title="File: Cargo.toml"
[profile.app-release]
inherits = "release"
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "z"
lto = true
debug = false
panic = "abort"
overflow-checks = true
```

<details>
<summary> Your `Cargo.toml` file should now look like this </summary>

```toml title="File: Cargo.toml" showLineNumbers
[package]
name = "kv-store"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# highlight-start
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
# highlight-end

# highlight-start
[dependencies]
calimero-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/calimero-network/core" }
calimero-storage = { git = "https://github.com/calimero-network/core" }
# highlight-end

# highlight-start
[profile.app-release]
inherits = "release"
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = "z"
lto = true
debug = false
panic = "abort"
overflow-checks = true
# highlight-end
```

</details>

And finally, create a `build.sh` script to compile your application into Wasm
format, for example:

```bash title="File: build.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
set -e

cd "$(dirname $0)"

TARGET="${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-../../target}"

rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile app-release

mkdir -p res

cp $TARGET/wasm32-unknown-unknown/app-release/kv_store.wasm ./res/
```

You can optionally choose to install and use
[`wasm-opt`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), for an additional
optimization step in the build script. This step is not required but can help
reduce the size of the generated Wasm file:

```bash title="File: build.sh"
if command -v wasm-opt > /dev/null; then
  wasm-opt -Oz ./res/kv_store.wasm -o ./res/kv_store.wasm
fi
```

Don't forget to make the `build.sh` script executable:

```bash title="Terminal"
chmod +x build.sh
```

At this point, your project structure should look like this:

```bash title="Terminal"
$ tree
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.sh
└── src
    └── lib.rs

2 directories, 3 files
```

### Writing Your Application

Now, let's create a simple key-value store application using the Calimero SDK.
Start by defining your application logic in `lib.rs`:

```rust title="File: src/lib.rs" showLineNumbers
use calimero_sdk::borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
use calimero_sdk::app;

#[app::state]
#[derive(Default, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
#[borsh(crate = "calimero_sdk::borsh")]
struct KvStore {}

#[app::logic]
impl KvStore {
    #[app::init]
    pub fn init() -> KvStore {
        KvStore {}
    }
}
```

The `KvStore` struct represents the state of your application, which will be
borsh-encoded in the app-scoped state partition on the node's storage. The
`#[app::state]` attribute macro marks the struct as the application state,
permitting its use by Calimero SDK.

The `#[app::logic]` attribute macro marks the implementation block as the
application logic, allowing you to define the methods that interact with the
application state. An initializer method (named `init`) is denoted by the
`#[app::init]` attribute macro, which is called when the application is executed
against a freshly created context.

Consider a method like `get` that retrieves a value from the key-value store:

```rust
pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, Error> {
    // Snip...
}
```

The inputs must be deserializable from the transaction data, and the output must
be serializable to the response data. The `Option` type is used to represent the
possibility of the key not being present in the store. The `Error` type is used
to represent the possible error conditions that may occur during the execution
of the method.

And now, here's a complete example of a key-value store application:

```rust title="File: src/lib.rs" showLineNumbers
use calimero_sdk::borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
use calimero_sdk::types::Error;
use calimero_sdk::{app, env};
use calimero_storage::collections::UnorderedMap;

#[app::state]
#[derive(Default, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
#[borsh(crate = "calimero_sdk::borsh")]
struct KvStore {
    entries: UnorderedMap<String, String>,
}

#[app::logic]
impl KvStore {
    #[app::init]
    pub fn init() -> KvStore {
        // highlight-start
        KvStore {
            items: UnorderedMap::new(),
        }
        // highlight-end
    }

    // highlight-start
    pub fn set(&mut self, key: String, value: String) -> Result<(), Error> {
        env::log(&format!("Setting key: {:?} to value: {:?}", key, value));

        self.entries.insert(key, value)?;

        Ok(())
    }
    // highlight-end

    // highlight-start
    pub fn entries(&self) -> Result<BTreeMap<String, String>, Error> {
        env::log("Getting all entries");

        Ok(self.items.entries()?.collect())
    }
    // highlight-end

    // highlight-start
    pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, Error> {
        env::log(&format!("Getting key: {:?}", key));

        self.items.get(key).map_err(Into::into)
    }
    // highlight-end

    // highlight-start
    pub fn remove(&mut self, key: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, Error> {
        env::log(&format!("Removing key: {:?}", key));

        self.items.remove(key).map_err(Into::into)
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

### Building Your Application

Once your application logic is defined, run the `./build.sh` script to compile
your application into Wasm format. This script will generate `kv_store.wasm` in
the `res` folder of your application.

```bash title="Terminal"
$ ./build.sh
info: component 'rust-std' for target 'wasm32-unknown-unknown' is up to date
   # Snip...
   Compiling calimero-sdk v0.1.0
   Compiling calimero-storage v0.1.0
   Compiling kv-store v0.1.0 (/apps/kv-store)
    Finished `app-release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 1.20s

$ tree
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.sh
├── res
│   └── kv_store.wasm
└── src
    └── lib.rs

3 directories, 4 files
```

### Deploying Your Application

After successfully building your application, you can upload the compiled
`kv_store.wasm` to the registry for use by a live Calimero node.

### Writing Efficient Code with Calimero SDK

In the following code snippet:

```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, Error> {
    // Snip...
}
```

you'll notice that we prioritize using references instead of owned values. This
approach optimizes performance and memory usage by minimizing unnecessary data
copying.

For input parameters, such as `&str` and `&[u8]`, utilizing references allows
you to avoid unnecessary copying of data. Similarly, for output values, you can
return references to data that live as long as `&self` or any of the input
parameters. By doing so, you reduce memory overhead and improve the overall
efficiency of your application.

### Handling Errors with Calimero SDK

When designing methods that may potentially fail, it's recommended to return a
`Result` type with an error variant representing the possible failure cases.
This enables you to handle errors more effectively and communicate error
conditions to users of your application. This is recommended over using the
`Error` type exported from `calimero_sdk` and over panicking. Both of which only
return a string message.

#### Error Report Comparison

Let's take the following cases (all of which fail when the key does not exist);

1. Using `calimero_sdk::types::Error`:

   This is provided for convenience, since most errors already don't implement
   `Serialize`, and so they cannot be immediately returned. This first converts
   the error to a string and then returns it. Which then JSON-encodes the string
   representation.

   ```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
   use calimero_sdk::types::Error;

   pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
       self.items.get(key)?.ok_or_else(|| Error::msg("key not found"))
   }
   ```

   This failure will result in this outcome:

   ```rust
   ExecutionError([ 107, 75, 101, 121, 32, 110, 111, 116, 32, 102, 111, 117, 110, 100, 34 ])
   ```

   which can be decoded to

   ```json
   "key not found"
   ```

   This `Error` can be constructed with `?` so long as the source error
   implements `std::error::Error`.

   Behaviourally similar to
   [`anyhow::Error`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/struct.Error.html) or
   [`eyre::Report`](https://docs.rs/eyre/latest/eyre/struct.Report.html).

2. Using a custom error type (recommended):

   For structured error handling, we recommend defining a custom error type that
   encodes all the possible error variants for that method. This allows you to
   provide more context about the error condition and handle different error
   scenarios more effectively. As opposed to string parsing.

   ```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
   use calimero_sdk::serde::Serialize;

   #[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
   #[serde(crate = "calimero_sdk::serde")]
   #[serde(tag = "kind", content = "data")]
   pub enum Error<'a> {
       NotFound(&'a str),
   }
   ```

   ```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
   pub fn get<'a>(&self, key: &'a str) -> Result<String, Error<'a>> {
       // Snip...
       Err(Error::NotFound(key))
   }
   ```

   This failure will result in this outcome:

   ```rust
   ExecutionError([ 123, 34, 107, 105, 110, 100, 34, 58, 34, 78, 111, 116, 70, 111, 117, 110, 100, 34, 44, 34, 100, 97, 116, 97, 34, 58, 34, 116, 104, 105, 110, 103, 34, 125 ])
   ```

   which can be decoded to

   ```json
   { "kind": "NotFound", "data": "thing" }
   ```

   As will most likely be the case, you may need to work with storage errors
   while you've defined a custom error type.

   In this case, you can pull in
   [`thiserror`](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) to help.

   ```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
   use thiserror::Error;

   #[derive(Debug, Error, Serialize)]
   #[serde(crate = "calimero_sdk::serde")]
   #[serde(tag = "kind", content = "data")]
   pub enum Error<'a> {
       #[error("key not found: {0}")]
       NotFound(&'a str),
       #[error("store error: {0}")]
       StoreError(#[from] StoreError),
   }
   ```

   ```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
   pub fn get<'a>(&self, key: &'a str) -> Result<String, Error<'a>> {
       // Snip...
       self.items.get(key)?.ok_or_else(|| Error::NotFound(key))
   }
   ```

   An example store error would then be represented as:

   ```rust
   ExecutionError(
       [
           123, 34, 107, 105, 110, 100, 34, 58, 34, 83, 116, 111, 114, 101, 69, 114, 114, 111, 114, 34, 44, 34, 100, 97, 116, 97, 34, 58,
           34, 73, 110, 100, 101, 120, 32, 110, 111, 116, 32, 102, 111, 117, 110, 100, 32, 102, 111, 114, 32, 73, 68, 58, 32, 57, 51, 49, 53,
           97, 98, 101, 49, 101, 97, 101, 48, 102, 102, 53, 98, 48, 48, 52, 53, 51, 97, 100, 97, 102, 99, 99, 53, 102, 101, 102, 50, 49, 100,
           55, 52, 49, 51, 57, 55, 101, 50, 49, 99, 53, 49, 53, 51, 55, 99, 51, 54, 52, 52, 50, 52, 50, 48, 56, 55, 52, 57, 99, 57, 34, 125,
       ],
   )
   ```

   which can be decoded to

   ```json
   {
     "kind": "StoreError",
     "data": "Index not found for ID: 9315abe1eae0ff5b00453adafcc5fef21d741397e21c51537c364424208749c9"
   }
   ```

3. Panic (ideally, development only)

   ```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
   pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> String {
       self.items.get(key).expect("store error").expect("key not found")
   }
   ```

   A non-existent key would then lead to this outcome:

   ```rust
   HostError(
       Panic {
           context: Guest,
           message: "key not found",
           location: At {
               file: "apps/kv-store/src/lib.rs",
               line: 98,
               column: 14,
           },
       },
   )
   ```

   And a storage error, would produce this:

   ```rust
   HostError(
       Panic {
           context: Guest,
           message: "store error: StorageError(IndexNotFound(Id { bytes: [123, 240, 135, 21, 77, 143, 81, 169, 15, 202, 99, 210, 167, 165, 188, 156, 87, 146, 7, 211, 100, 92, 169, 189, 124, 115, 200, 242, 240, 73, 68, 123] }))",
           location: At {
               file: "apps/kv-store/src/lib.rs",
               line: 98,
               column: 14,
           },
       },
   )
   ```

By following the second (recommended) approach, you can handle errors more
gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users of your Calimero
application.

And the first approach, if you want a hassle-free method of dealing with errors.

### Emitting Events with Calimero SDK

To facilitate real-time monitoring of state transitions within your Calimero
application, you can emit events using the `app::emit!` macro provided by the
Calimero SDK. Event emission is particularly useful for handling live state
transitions triggered by other actors, allowing subscribed clients to receive
immediate updates about relevant actions.

Let's focus on emitting events for mutating calls, specifically `set` and
`remove` methods:

First, define your custom events using the `#[app::event]` proc macro. In this
example, we'll define events for setting a new key-value pair (`Inserted`),
updating an existing value (`Updated`), and removing a key-value pair
(`Removed`):

```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
use calimero_sdk::app;

#[app::event]
pub enum Event<'a> {
    Inserted { key: &'a str, value: &'a str },
    Updated { key: &'a str, value: &'a str },
    Removed { key: &'a str },
}
```

Each event variant can carry additional data to provide context about the event.

Now, you need to associate the event with the application logic by annotating
the application state.

```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
// highlight-start
#[app::state(emits = for<'a> Event<'a>)]
// highlight-end
#[derive(Default, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
#[borsh(crate = "calimero_sdk::borsh")]
struct KvStore {
    // Snip...
}
```

And finally, within your application logic methods, emit events using the
`app::emit!` macro:

```rust title="File: src/lib.rs"
pub fn set(&mut self, key: String, value: String) -> Result<(), Error> {
    if self.items.contains(&key)? {
        app::emit!(Event::Updated {
            key: &key,
            value: &value,
        });
    } else {
        app::emit!(Event::Inserted {
            key: &key,
            value: &value,
        });
    }

    self.items.insert(key, value)?;

    Ok(())
}

pub fn remove(&mut self, key: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    app::emit!(Event::Removed { key });

    self.entries.remove(key)?.ok_or_else(|| Error::msg("key not found"))
}
```

In each method, we emit the corresponding event with relevant data. This allows
external observers to react to these events and take appropriate actions.

By emitting events, you can ensure connected clients receive real-time updates
about state transitions within your Calimero application, enabling them to
respond to changes as they occur.

### Ensuring Atomicity and Event Reliability in Calimero Applications

In Calimero applications, ensuring atomicity of state changes and reliability of
event emission is crucial for maintaining data consistency and facilitating
reliable communication between actors. Here's how atomicity and event
reliability are enforced:

#### Atomic State Changes

When a method call fails, whether due to panics or returning an `Err`, all state
changes made up to that point are discarded. This ensures that if an operation
cannot be completed successfully, the application's state remains consistent and
unaffected by partial updates. By enforcing atomicity, Calimero promotes data
integrity and prevents inconsistencies that may arise from incomplete
transactions.

#### Reliable Event Emission

Similarly, event emission in Calimero applications is tied to the successful
execution of transactions. Events are only relayed when a transaction has been
successfully executed, ensuring that external observers receive updates about
state changes reliably. By linking event emission to transaction execution,
Calimero guarantees that event notifications accurately reflect the
application's current state, enhancing the reliability and consistency of
communication between actors.

This also means it doesn't matter if the event emission is done before or after
the state change, as the event will only be emitted if the state change is
successful.

By adhering to these principles of atomicity and event reliability, Calimero
applications maintain data integrity and enable robust interaction between
different components, facilitating the development of secure and dependable
decentralized systems.

### Local-First Efficiency: No Network Overhead for Read-Only Calls

In Calimero, adherence to the local-first principle eliminates the need for
network communication in read-only calls. Since read-only operations don't
modify the state, there's no associated network overhead. This local-first
approach streamlines data access, promoting efficient and responsive application
performance without unnecessary network activity.
