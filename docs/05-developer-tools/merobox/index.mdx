# Merobox Overview

Merobox is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the
development, testing, and deployment of Calimero applications. It provides a
robust framework for managing Calimero nodes in Docker, orchestrating complex
workflows with YAML configurations, and integrating with popular testing
frameworks.

## Key Features

- **Node Management**: Easily run, stop, list, and manage Calimero nodes in
  isolated Docker containers.
- **Workflow Automation**: Define and execute multi-step workflows using
  declarative YAML files for tasks like application installation, context
  creation, identity management, and function calls.
- **Application Lifecycle**: Simplify the process of deploying and interacting
  with Calimero applications.
- **Context Orchestration**: Manage blockchain contexts, including creation,
  invitations, and joining.
- **Identity Management**: Generate and manage cryptographic identities for
  testing and development.
- **Testing Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Python testing frameworks
  like Pytest for ephemeral node and workflow setups.
- **Dynamic Value Capture**: Capture and reuse outputs from previous steps
  within your workflows.
- **Authentication Service Integration**: Configure and interact with Calimero's
  authentication service.
