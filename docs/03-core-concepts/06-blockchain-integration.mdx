# Blockchain Integrations

Calimero offers integration with multiple blockchain protocols, allowing users
to interact with the blockchain and perform read and write operations.

## Current Blockchain Integrations

Calimero currently supports the following blockchain protocols:

- NEAR
- Starknet
- Internet Computer (ICP)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Calimero] --> B[Integrations]
B --> C[NEAR]
B --> D[Starknet]
B --> E[ICP]
```

</div>

## Operations

- Read
- Read the data from the Calimero contracts.
- Write
- Write data to any contract on the same blockchain protocol through
  cross-contract calls in the Proxy Contract.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Calimero]
B[Context Contract]
C[Proxy Contract]
D[Transfers]
E[Cross-Contract Calls]

A <--> B
A <--> C
C --> D
C --> E
```

</div>

## Functionalities

- Cross-contract calls
- Transfers
- Storage of arbitrary data
- Configuration of the internal configuration variables
- Proposal creation and execution

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Proxy Contract] -->|Cross-contract Calls| B[Other Contracts]
A -->|Transfers| C[Token Transfers]
A -->|Data Storage| D[Key-Value Storage]
A -->|Configuration| E[Internal Variables]
E -->|Change Votes Required| F[Vote Configuration]
E -->|Change Proposal Limits| G[Proposal Limits]
```

</div>

## Functionality Details

- **Cross-contract calls**: Proxy contract allows making cross-contract calls to
  other contracts on the same blockchain protocol. Users need to specify the
  contract address, the method to call, and the arguments for that method.
- **Transfers**: Proxy contract allows transferring tokens to the specified
  address. Users need to specify the recipient address and the amount of tokens
  to transfer.
- **Storage of arbitrary data**: Proxy contract allows storing arbitrary data in
  the context storage. Users need to specify the key and the value for the data
  to be stored.
- **Configuration of the internal configuration variables**: Configure the
  internal configuration variables of the Calimero contracts:
- **Vote configuration**: Number of votes required for a proposals to be
  approved (u32)
- **Proposal limits**: Maximum number of proposals that one user can have at the
  same time(u32)
- **Proposal creation and execution**: Proposals are created by users and
  contain one or multiple actions that are voted on by the users of the context.
  If a proposal is approved, it is automatically executed by the Calimero Proxy
  Contract.

## Calimero Contracts

Calimero integrates two types of contracts for each blockchain protocol:

- Context Contract
- Proxy Contract

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

```mermaid
graph TD
A[User] -->|Creates Context| B[Context Contract]
B -->|Creates| C[Context]
B -->|Adds Admin| D[User as Admin]
B -->|Deploys| E[Proxy Contract]
E -->|Handles| F[Proposals, Votes, Execution]
F -->|Executes Actions| G[Blockchain Operations]
```

</div>

### Context Contract

The Context Contract is responsible for creating contexts, adding and removing
members, editing their privileges, and associating specific applications with a
context.

### Proxy Contract

Each context has its own Proxy Contract instance which is deployed during the
context creation.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' ,margin: '2rem'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
A[User] -->|Creates Proposal| B[Proxy Contract]
B -->|Stores Proposal| C[Proposal Storage]
C -->|Voting by Members| D{Required Votes Met?}
D -->|Yes| E[Execute Proposal]
D -->|No| F[Store Vote Count]
```

</div>

Tutorial on how to use proxy contract functionalities is available in
[tutorials section](../../tutorials/proxy-contract-interaction)

### Deployment of Contracts

#### Context Contract

Context Contract is predeployed on each blockchain by the Calimero team.

#### Proxy Contract

Proxy Contract is deployed during the context creation.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Calimero Team] -->|Pre-deploys| B[Context Contract]
B -->|During Context Creation| C[Proxy Contract]
C -->|Unique Instance| D[Context-specific Proxy]
```

</div>

:::info

Proxy Contract is deployed on the same blockchain as the Context Contract.

:::

:::warning

Users are responsible for funding the Proxy Contract.

### Example Application

We have an example application that connects to Calimero Proxy Contract and
allows creating proposals, voting on them, and executing the approved proposals.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem' }}>
```mermaid
graph TD
A[Application] -->|Connects to| B[Calimero Proxy Contract]
B -->|Handles| C[Proposals]
C -->|Create| D[New Proposals]
C -->|Approve| E[Proposal Voting]
C -->|Delete| J[Delete Proposal]
E -->|Check Votes| F{Required Votes Met?}
F -->|Yes| G[Execute Proposal]
G -->|Perform Actions| H[Blockchain Operations]
F -->|No| I[Store Vote Count]
```
</div>

Application showcases all the actions that can be done on the Proxy Contract.

To create context on specific blockchain user will need to add the --protocol
when initializing the node
