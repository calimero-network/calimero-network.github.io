# Context Contract

Calimero Context Contract is used to manage the context on the blockchain. It is
predeployed on each blockchain by the Calimero team. It is used to create the
context, add members to the context, and configure the context.

## Setup

To create context on specific blockchain user will need to add the `--protocol`
flag to the `calimero-cli` when initializing the node as explained in the
[Setup](/getting-started/setup) section.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="starknet"
    values={[
        {label: 'Starknet', value: 'starknet'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="starknet">
```bash title="Start node with Starknet protocol"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528 --protocol starknet
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Note**: NEAR protocol is set by default, so if user wants to use NEAR
protocol, he doesn't need to specify the `--protocol` flag.

After the node is initialized, user can see the Context Contract address in the
`config.toml` file located in the node folder.

After initialization, user needs to start the node by running the following
command:

```bash title="Start node"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data run
```

Before creating the context, user needs to compile the
demo-blockchain-integrations application. To compile the application, please
clone the
[demo-blockchain-integrations](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations)
repository and follow the instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations/blob/main/README.md).

After the application is compiled, user needs to install the application on the
node and then create the context with the application. To create the context and
install the application, please follow the
[Create Context](/tutorials/create-context) tutorial.
