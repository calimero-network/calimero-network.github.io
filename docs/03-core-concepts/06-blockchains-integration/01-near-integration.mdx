# NEAR Protocol Integration

Calimero offers integration with the NEAR Protocol, allowing users to
authenticate using their NEAR accounts. This integration provides access to
essential blockchain functionalities, enabling users to read data directly from
the NEAR blockchain and perform write operations securely.

## Blockchain Integration - NEAR

Calimero offers robust integration with the NEAR Protocol, leveraging its
blockchain capabilities to facilitate secure and efficient interactions. This
section focuses on the setup of the NEAR smart contracts used for configuration
management, highlighting the key concepts of contexts, members, privileges, and
the new proxy contract functionality.

### 1. Current Setup

The current setup uses NEAR smart contracts to manage configuration variables
essential to the network’s structure. This setup includes two primary contracts:
the **Context Contract** and the **Proxy Contract**. Together, they store
essential information related to user roles, privileges, and network contexts
and provide a flexible structure for proposals and actions. Proposals serve as a
way to put decisions up for a vote, and if approved, the specified action is
executed, enabling interactions with other accounts and contracts.

#### Key Components of the NEAR Contracts

##### Contexts (Context Contract)

- **Definition**: Contexts represent the network or domain that users are part
  of. They define the boundaries within which transactions and interactions
  occur.
- **Creation and Management**: When a new context is created, a subaccount is
  automatically generated, and a new instance of the Proxy Contract is deployed
  on this subaccount.
- **Role of Context Contract**: The Context Contract is responsible for creating
  contexts, adding members, editing their privileges, and associating specific
  applications with a context.

##### Proxy Contract

- **Definition**: The Proxy Contract is deployed on a subaccount for each new
  context and serves as a governance mechanism within the context. It supports a
  decentralized process for making and implementing decisions through a proposal
  and voting system.
- **Purpose**: The Proxy Contract allows context members to create proposals
  that outline specific actions, which must then be voted on by other members of
  the context. Only if a proposal receives the required number of votes will the
  specified action be executed, ensuring that decisions are made collectively.

- **Proposal Creation**: Any member of a context can create a proposal in the
  Proxy Contract. Proposals are requests to perform certain actions and contain
  detailed information about the proposed action. These actions can include:

  - **Cross-Contract Calls**: Interactions with other smart contracts on the
    NEAR blockchain.
  - **Fund Transfers**: Moving funds from the Proxy Contract to a designated
    address.
  - **Configuration Adjustments**: Modifying configuration settings within the
    Proxy Contract itself.

- **Voting and Approval Process**:

  - **Eligibility Check**: The Proxy Contract first verifies that the proposal
    creator is a registered member of the context by interacting with the
    Context Contract.
  - **Voting Requirements**: Context members review and vote on the proposal.
    Each proposal has a vote threshold defined in the Proxy Contract
    configuration, which specifies the minimum number of votes required for
    approval.
  - **Proposal Approval**: If the proposal reaches the necessary vote count, the
    Proxy Contract proceeds with executing the proposed action.

- **Execution of Actions**: Once a proposal is approved, the Proxy Contract
  performs the specified action, ensuring a secure and automated implementation
  of context decisions.

- **Funding Mechanism**:

  - Members are responsible for ensuring the Proxy Contract is funded to support
    proposal execution. Funds must be available in the Proxy Contract account to
    cover actions involving transactions or resource allocation.
  - This mechanism encourages members to manage the resources needed to
    implement proposals effectively and to be aware of contract balances.

- **Benefits and Use Cases**:
  - **Decentralized Governance**: The Proxy Contract offers a structured,
    transparent way for members to propose and approve changes, fostering a
    collaborative environment within each context.
  - **Flexible Interaction**: By supporting cross-contract calls, fund
    transfers, and configuration updates, the Proxy Contract allows contexts to
    interact with other contracts and adjust settings dynamically as needs
    evolve.
  - **Security and Verification**: The built-in membership check and voting
    thresholds ensure only authorized members can propose and approve actions,
    maintaining a secure and controlled process for context operations.

Together, the Context and Proxy Contracts allow for secure, decentralized
management of roles, permissions, and interactions, facilitating both governance
and operational actions within each context.
