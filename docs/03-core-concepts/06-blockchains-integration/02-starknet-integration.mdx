# Starknet Integration

Calimero offers integration with Starknet, allowing users to authenticate using
their Starknet accounts. Currently, this integration supports login
functionality through ArgentX wallet and Metamask Snap, providing a secure and
user-friendly way to access the Admin Dashboard.

## Current Limitations

### Read-Only Functionality

- At present, the Starknet integration is limited to authentication and login
  functionality.
- Read and write operations on the Starknet blockchain are not yet implemented
  in this version of the integration.

### Future Developments

We are actively working on expanding the Starknet integration to include:

1. **Read Operations**: Implementing secure methods to read data from the
   Starknet blockchain.
2. **Write Operations**: Developing functionality for users to perform write
   operations on the Starknet blockchain.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance our Starknet integration
capabilities.
