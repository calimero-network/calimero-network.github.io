# Blockchain Integrations

Calimero offers integration with multiple blockchain protocols, allowing users to
interact with the blockchain and perform read and write operations.

## Current Blockchain Integrations

Calimero currently supports the following blockchain protocols:

- NEAR
- Starknet

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Calimero] --> B[Integrations]
    B --> C[NEAR]
    B --> D[Starknet]
    
```
</div>

---

## Supported Operations

- Read
  - Read the data from the Calimero contracts.
- Write
  - Write data to any contract on the same blockchain protocol through cross-contract calls in the Proxy Contract.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Calimero]
    B[Context Contract]
    C[Proxy Contract]
    D[Transfers]
    E[Cross-Contract Calls]

    A <--> B
    A <--> C
    C --> D
    C --> E
```

</div>

## Supported Functionalities

- Cross-contract calls
- Transfers
- Storage of arbitrary data
- Configuration of the internal configuration variables
- Proposal creation and execution

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Proxy Contract] -->|Cross-contract Calls| B[Other Contracts]
    A -->|Transfers| C[Token Transfers]
    A -->|Data Storage| D[Key-Value Storage]
    A -->|Configuration| E[Internal Variables]
    E -->|Change Votes Required| F[Vote Configuration]
    E -->|Change Proposal Limits| G[Proposal Limits]
```

---

## Functionality Details

- **Cross-contract calls**: Proxy contract allows making cross-contract calls to
  other contracts on the same blockchain protocol. Users need to specify the contract
  address, the method to call, and the arguments for that method.
- **Transfers**: Proxy contract allows transferring tokens to the specified address.
  Users need to specify the recipient address and the amount of tokens to transfer.
- **Storage of arbitrary data**: Proxy contract allows storing arbitrary data
  in the context storage. Users need to specify the key and the value for the data
  to be stored.
- **Configuration of the internal configuration variables**: Configure the
  internal configuration variables of the Calimero contracts.
- **Proposal creation and execution**: Proposals are created by users and
  contain one or multiple actions that are voted on by the users of the context. If a proposal
  is approved, it is automatically executed by the Calimero Proxy Contract.

## Calimero Contracts

Calimero integrates two types of contracts for each blockchain protocol:

- Context Contract
- Proxy Contract

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Creates Context| B[Context Contract]
    B -->|Creates| C[Context]
    B -->|Adds Admin| D[User as Admin]
    B -->|Deploys| E[Proxy Contract]
    E -->|Handles| F[Proposals, Votes, Execution]
    F -->|Executes Actions| G[Blockchain Operations]
```
</div>
---

### Context Contract

The Context Contract is responsible for creating contexts, adding and removing
members, editing their privileges, and associating specific applications with a
context.

---

### Proxy Contract

Each context has its own Proxy Contract instance which is deployed during the
context creation.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Creates Proposal| B[Proxy Contract]
    B -->|Stores Proposal| C[Proposal Storage]
    C -->|Voting by Members| D{Required Votes Met?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Execute Proposal]
    E -->|Proposal Deleted| F[Contract Storage]
    D -->|No| G[Proposal Discarded]
    G -->|Optional| H[Delete to Free Space]
```
</div>
---

### Deployment of Contracts

#### Context Contract
Context Contract is predeployed on each blockchain by the Calimero team.

#### Proxy Contract
Proxy Contract is deployed during the context creation.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Calimero Team] -->|Pre-deploys| B[Context Contract]
    B -->|During Context Creation| C[Proxy Contract]
    C -->|Unique Instance| D[Context-specific Proxy]
```

</div>

### Example Application

We have an example application that connects to Calimero Proxy Contract and allows
creating proposals, voting on them, and executing the approved proposals.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Example Application] -->|Connects to| B[Calimero Proxy Contract]
    B -->|Handles| C[Proposals]
    C -->|Create| D[New Proposals]
    C -->|Vote| E[Proposal Voting]
    C -->|Execute| F[Approved Proposals]
    F -->|Perform Actions| G[Blockchain Operations]
```
</div>
