# Blockchain Integrations

Calimero offers integration with multiple blockchain protocols, allowing users to
interact with the blockchain and perform read and write operations.


## Current Blockchain Integrations

Calimero currently supports the following blockchain protocols:

- NEAR
- Starknet

## Supported Operations

- Read
  - Read the data from the Calimero contracts
- Write
  - Write the data to the Calimero contracts


## Supported Functionalities

- Cross-contract calls
- Transfers
- Storage of arbitrary data
- Configuration of the internal configuration variables
- Proposal creation and execution


## Functionality Details

- **Cross-contract calls**: Proxy contract allows to make cross-contract calls to
  the other contracts on the same blockchain protocol. Users need to specify the contract
  address and the method to call as well as the arguments for that method.
- **Transfers**: Proxy contract allows to transfer tokens to the specified address.
  Users need to specify the recipient address and the amount of tokens to transfer.
- **Storage of arbitrary data**: Proxy contract allows to store arbitrary data
  in the context storage. Users need to specify the key and the value for the data
  to be stored.
- **Configuration of the internal configuration variables**: Configure the
  internal configuration variables of the Calimero contracts.
- **Proposal creation and execution**: Proposals are created by users and
  contain one or multiple actions that are voted on by the users of the context. If a proposal
  is approved, it is automatically executed by the Calimero Proxy Contract.
  Proposals can be created by any user that is a part of the context and can contain following actions:
  - Cross-contract calls
  - Transfers
  - Storage of arbitrary data
  - Configuration of the internal configuration variables:
    - Configure the number of votes required to approve a proposal
    - Configure the maximum number of active proposals


## Calimero Contracts

Calimero integrates two types of contracts for each blockchain protocol:

- Context Contract
- Proxy Contract


### Context Contract

The Context Contract is responsible for creating contexts, adding and removing
members, editing their privileges, and associating specific applications with a
context.

When user creates a new context through the Calimero CLI, the Context Contract
does the following:
- Creates a new context
- Adds the user as a member to the context:
  - Sets the user's privileges as admin
  - Adds the user to the list of members
  - Deploys a new instance of the Proxy Contract specific to this context

User can then invite new members to the context, edit their privileges, and remove
them from the context.

### Proxy Contract

Each context has its own Proxy Contract instance which is deployed during the
context creation.

The Proxy Contract is responsible for creating proposals, voting on them, and
executing the approved proposals.

**Note**: Users are responsible for funding the Proxy Contract, users can get Proxy Contract address
by calling the `proxy_contract` method of the Context Contract with the context id as an argument and then
seeding the Proxy Contract with the required tokens.

Each proposal contains one or multiple actions that are voted on by the members of the context.
If a proposal is approved, it is executed by the Proxy Contract.

Proposals can contain the following actions:
- Cross-contract calls
- Transfers
- Storage of arbitrary data - key-value pairs are stored in the contract storage
- Configuration of the internal configuration variables of the Proxy Contract

During the proposal approval process, the following happens:
- The proposal is stored in the contract storage
- The proposal is voted on by the members of the context - proxy contract verifies
  that the proposal creator is a registered member of the context by interacting
  with the Context Contract
- If the proposal receives the required number of votes, it is executed by the
  Proxy Contract
- The proposal is deleted from the contract storage

If the limit of users active proposals is reached, user will need to delete some
of the existing proposals before creating a new one.

There are two types of configuration variables:
- Number of votes required to approve a proposal
- Maximum number of active proposals per user

**Note**: This configuration variables are set on contract level, which means that
they will be applied to all the proposals and needed vote number.

To change these configuration variables, user needs to create a proposal with the
corresponding action.

### Deployment of Contracts

#### Context Contract
Context Contract is predeployed on each blockchain by the Calimero team.

#### Proxy Contract
Proxy Contract is deployed during the context creation.

Currently, contracts are deployed on Testnet network of each protocol.

**Note**: If you want to deploy the contracts on Mainnet, please contact us.


### Limitations
- Results from the cross-contract calls are not verified or stored.
- Results from the proposals are not stored.
- Needed approvals for proposals are applied for every proposal.
- Executed proposals are not stored.
- If proxy contract doesn't have enough balance, proposal action will fail (if funds are needed).
- For reading the data from contracts other then Calimero contracts, users need to
  implement the corresponding logic in the application layer.


### Example applications

We have an example application that connects to Calimero Proxy Contract and allows
to create proposals, vote on them, and execute the approved proposals.

You can find the example application [here](https://github.com/calimero-network/demo-blockchain-integrations).
