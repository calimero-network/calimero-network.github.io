# Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Integration

Calimero offers integration with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), allowing
users to authenticate using their Internet Identity (II). This integration
provides a secure and user-friendly way to access the Admin Dashboard using
ICP's robust authentication system.

## Current Limitations

### Authentication-Only Functionality

- At present, the ICP integration is primarily focused on authentication and
  login functionality.

## Future Developments

We are actively working on expanding the ICP integration to include:

1. **Read Operations**: Implementing secure methods to read data from the
   Internet Computer.
2. **Write Operations**: Developing functionality for users to perform write
   operations on ICP canisters.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance our ICP integration
capabilities.
