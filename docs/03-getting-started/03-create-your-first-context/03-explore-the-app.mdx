Congratulations, you now have a working context with the coordinator running! As
you have created context with the core app template application let's access
that frontend. In the table click on the website column of core-app-template ->
https://calimero-network.github.io/core-app-template/

Once the page opens, enter the Application ID you received during the invitation
process, and that's itâ€”you're ready to start using your first SSapp!
