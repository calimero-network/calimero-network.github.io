## Invite to context with meroctl CLI

Inviting to the context consists of 3 steps:

1. Peer who wants to join context, needs to share his identity with the invitor.
2. Invitor creates an invitation to the context by creating an invitation
   payload.
3. Invitee accepts the invitation by signing invitation payload to prove his
   identity.

If you want to join context, you can create new identity by running the
following command:

```bash
context identity new
```

```bash title="Example"
context identity new
│ Private Key: G5pK45VAegesDwvHqyQsZ6NNQyRPjZ7YQLJSz1XBfpdc
│ Public Key: 21A1pcDPMJTH6bQb1xRw1i1JqDRmvysxYp7eEQMnz3sp
```

Listed public key is your inviteeContextIdentity used below. Share it with the
invitor to invite you to the context.

Existing member of a context, needs to create invitation.

```bash
context invite {contextId} {invitorContextIdentity } {inviteeContextIdentity}
```

```bash title="Example"

following command:

```
