title: Initialize And Run Node
---

This guide will help you to initialize and run the node. You can do it in two
ways.

- Using CLI
- Using Docker compose

If this is your first time initializing the node, the process may take a little
bit more time until all dependencies are downloaded. It will take around 7
minutes but can vary depending on your internet connection.

    defaultValue="cli"

        {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
        {label: 'Docker Compose', value: 'docker'},
    ]}>

### 1. Initialize node

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
```

> **_NOTE:_** A `--protocol` flag defines protocol for the context. Currently,
> we support Starknet and NEAR protocol. By default, the protocol is set to NEAR
> protocol, but you can set it explicitly to Starknet by using the following
> command:
>
> ```bash title="Terminal"
> cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528 --protocol starknet
> ```

> You can also view these settings in the config.toml file located within the
> node folder.

### 2. Run node

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p merod -- --node-name node1 --home data run
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.

When you see something like this that means that node is now ready for use.

<TabItem value="docker">

### 1. First build the image

```bash title="Terminal"
docker buildx build -t 'merod' .
```

### 2. Then setup and run the nodes defined in `docker-compose.yml` file

```bash title="Terminal"
docker compose up
```

### 3. Connect to the available node by listing running containers

```bash title="Terminal"
docker ps
```

and then attach to the selected container

```bash title="Node Terminal"
docker attach core-app_node_run-1
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.
