We have created simple and easy to use example application called `only-peers`.
Application enables writing posts and leaving comments. To try out application
you need to create new context where application will be installed.

### Create new context

To create new context, node CLI has to be used. There are two possible options
of creating new context.

1. If the node already has application installed, create new context using
   command:

```bash title="Terminal"
$ meroctl context create --application <app-id>
>> <context-id>
```

2. If application is not installed then install the application and create new
   context using commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
$ meroctl app install --path /path/to/app
>> <app-id>
$ meroctl context create --application <app-id>
>> <context-id>
```

You are now part of the context and can start using the application.

<!-- If you want others to join your context, follow instruction in [Invite To Context](./04-invite-to-context.mdx). -->

### Try out Only-peers application

We have built and deployed a demo app so you can try it out immediately.

Navigate to https://calimero-network.github.io/only-peers-client/ to access app
frontend.

You will be asked to setup the app by the adding the node url. It is the same
url you used while starting the node in
[Getting-started](./01-init-and-run-node.mdx) `http://localhost:NODE_PORT` After
setting up node url, you will be asked to login.

> **_NOTE:_** Use your wallet which you have already added as root key in
> [Admin Dashboard. ](./02-admin-dashboard.mdx)

You are now ready to use the app. Enjoy!
