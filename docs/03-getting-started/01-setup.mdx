Before you start, make sure you are familiar with
[Calimero Terminology](/learn/terminology).

## Setup your local node

### Prerequisites

Clone repository from GitHub.

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone git@github.com:calimero-network/core.git
```

Position in the root of the project and create a data folder for all
configuration files.

```bash title="Terminal"
$ mkdir data
```

Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by
following the instructions on the
[Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

> **_NOTE:_** Use minimum rust version 1.80.0

### Setup

Setup coordinator node used for managing the network transactions and peer nodes
representing the network participants.

#### Initialize and start coordinator node (separate terminal)

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- --node-name coordinator --home data init --server-port 2427 --swarm-port 2527
cargo run -p meroctl -- --node-name coordinator --home data run --node-type coordinator
```

#### Initialize and start your node (separate terminal)

```bash title="Terminal"
cargo run -p meroctl -- --node-name node1 --home data init --server-port 2428 --swarm-port 2528
cargo run -p meroctl -- --node-name node1 --home data run
```

Node is now initialized and ready for use.

### SSL/TLS Support

To be able to access the the node from external source on the same network you
will need to install the generated self-signed certificate.

> **_NOTE:_** Installing the SSL certificate is only necessary if you plan to
> access the node from an external source on the same network. If you are
> running the application locally, you do not need to install the certificate.

### Steps to Add the Certificate to Your Device

1. **Locate the Certificate**:

   - Download the certificate from
     `http://localhost:<server-port>/admin-api/certificate`.
   - The `<server-port>` is the port number used as an argument in the
     `--server-port` flag in the section
     [Initialize and start your node (separate terminal)](#initialize-and-start-your-node-separate-terminal).
   - For example: \`\`\`bash http://localhost:2428/admin-api/certificate \`\`\`

2. **Add the Certificate to Trusted Certificates**:

   - **For Windows**:

     1. Open the `Run` dialog (Win + R) and type `mmc` to open the Microsoft
        Management Console.
     2. Go to `File` -> `Add/Remove Snap-in...`.
     3. Select `Certificates` and click `Add`.
     4. Choose `Computer account`, then `Next` and `Finish`.
     5. Expand `Certificates (Local Computer)` ->
        `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`.
     6. Right-click `Certificates`, then `All Tasks` -> `Import...`.
     7. Follow the prompts to import the certificate file.

   - **For macOS**:

     1. Double-click the certificate file.
     2. This will open the `Keychain Access` application.
     3. Choose `System` from the list of keychains.
     4. Drag and drop the certificate into the `System` keychain.
     5. Authenticate with your administrator password if prompted.
     6. Right-click the certificate and select `Get Info`.
     7. Expand the `Trust` section and select `Always Trust` from the
        `When using this certificate` dropdown.

   - **For Linux**:
     1. Copy the certificate to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` (or
        `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` depending on your distribution).
     2. Run `sudo update-ca-certificates` (or `sudo update-ca-trust extract` for
        Red Hat-based distributions).

3. **Restart Your Browser**:
   - Close and reopen your web browser to ensure it recognizes the newly added
     certificate.

### Rules for Generating SSL Certificates

- If a certificate doesn't exist, a new one will be generated based on your
  current local IP address.
- If a certificate exists for the current IP address, it will be used.
- If a certificate exists but is not configured for the current IP address, a
  new certificate will be created.

> **_NOTE:_** Every time a new certificate is generated (e.g., on the first
> start of the server or when the IP address changes), you will need to add it
> to your device's trusted certificates.

### Congratulations on Setting Up Your Node!

Your next step is to add an authentication mechanism to your node by adding a
decentralized identity.
