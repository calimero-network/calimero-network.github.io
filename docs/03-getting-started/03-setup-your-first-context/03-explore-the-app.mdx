Congratulations, you now have a working context with the coordinator running! As
you have created context with the core app template application let's access
that frontend. In the table click on the website column of core-app-template ->
https://calimero-network.github.io/core-app-template/

Once the page opens, enter the Application ID you received during the invitation
process, and that's it—you're ready to start using your first SSapp!

It's a simple counter app that allows you and everyone in the context to
increment the counter and view updates from other peers in real time. Though
basic, it’s a powerful introduction to the world of data privacy and ownership,
showcasing how decentralized control works in practice.
