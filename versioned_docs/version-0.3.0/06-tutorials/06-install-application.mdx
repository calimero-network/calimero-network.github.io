We have created simple and easy to use example application called `only-peers`.
Application enables writing posts and leaving comments. To try out application
you need to create new context where application will be installed.

### Create new context

To create new context, node CLI has to be used.

If the node doesn't have application installed, you need to install the
application first. If the application is already installed, you can skip this
step.

```bash
meroctl --node-name node1 app install --path /path/to/app
```

:::note 

If you want to install an application that is published in rthe egistry, check `meroctl --node-name node1 app install -h` for options
:::

After the application is installed, you can create new context:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="near"
    values={[
        {label: 'Near', value: 'near'},
        {label: 'Starknet', value: 'starknet'},
        {label: 'ICP', value: 'icp'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="near">
```bash title="Terminal"
meroctl --node-name node1 context create --application-id <app-id> --protocol near
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="starknet">
```bash title="Terminal"
meroctl --node-name node1 context create --application-id <app-id> --protocol starknet
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="icp">
```bash title="Terminal"
meroctl --node-name node1 context create --application-id <app-id> --protocol icp
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You are now part of the context and can start using the application.

<!-- If you want others to join your context, follow instruction in [Invite To Context](./04-invite-to-context.mdx). -->

### Try out Only-peers application

We have built and deployed a demo app so you can try it out immediately.

Navigate to https://calimero-network.github.io/only-peers-client/ to access app
frontend.

You will be asked to setup the app by the adding the node url. It is the same
url you used while starting the node in
[Getting-started](../getting-started/setup) `http://localhost:NODE_PORT` After
setting up node url, you will be asked to login.

> **_NOTE:_** Use your wallet which you have already added as root key in
> [Admin Dashboard](../developer-tools/apps/admin-dashboard)

You are now ready to use the app. Enjoy!
