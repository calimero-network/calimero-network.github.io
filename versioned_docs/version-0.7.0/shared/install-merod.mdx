You can choose to install `merod` using either the installation script or
Homebrew.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="homebrew"
    values={[
        {label: 'Homebrew', value: 'homebrew'},
        {label: 'Installation Script', value: 'script'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="homebrew">
If you use Homebrew, you can install `merod` directly with the following
steps:

#### Steps

1. Add the Calimero Homebrew tap:

   ```bash
   brew tap calimero-network/homebrew-tap
   ```

2. Install `merod`:

   ```bash
   brew install merod
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   merod --version
   ```

If the version number appears, the installation was successful.

<TabItem value="script">
The installation script supports multiple terminal environments and will
automatically configure your PATH based on your shell.

#### Steps

1. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calimero-network/install-sh/master/install-merod.sh | bash
   ```

2. Source the updated PATH:

   ```bash
   source <your-shell-config-file>
   ```

   Replace `<your-shell-config-file>` with `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or the relevant
   configuration file for your shell.

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   merod --version
   ```

If the version number appears, the installation was successful.

#### Notes for Shell Environments

The script automatically updates your PATH based on your shell configuration:

- **Bash**: Updates `.bashrc`.
- **Zsh**: Updates `.zshrc`.
- **Fish**: Modifies `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
- **Csh/Tcsh**: Updates `.cshrc`.

To apply the changes immediately, use the `source` command as described in step
2 above.
