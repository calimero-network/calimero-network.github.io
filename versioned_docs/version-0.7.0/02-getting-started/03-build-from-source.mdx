## Setup For Contributors

If you want to contribute to the Calimero framework or customize its
functionality, you can build it from source.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Rust is installed. If not, follow the instructions on the
  [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Troubleshooting

- If Rust dependencies fail, ensure your Rust installation is up-to-date:

  ```bash
  rustup update
  ```

- Verify that you have all required permissions to run the node.

For further support, open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/calimero-network/core/issues).

### Setup steps

Setup consists of few steps and is around 9 minutes long. (mostly waiting for
project dependencies to download)

1. Clone repository from GitHub (1min)
2. Position in the root of the project (< 1min)
3. Initialize and run node (~7 mins)

### 1. Clone repository from GitHub

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ssh"
    values={[
        {label: 'SSH', value: 'ssh'},
        {label: 'HTTPS', value: 'https'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="https">
```bash title="Clone using HTTPS"
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/core.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ssh">
```bash title="Clone using SSH"
git clone git@github.com:calimero-network/core.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Position in the root of the project

```bash title="Terminal"
cd core
```

### 3. Initialize and run node

You can do it in two ways.

- Using CLI
- Using Docker compose

If this is your first time initializing the node, the process may take a little
bit more time until all dependencies are downloaded. It will take around 7
minutes but can vary depending on your internet connection.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="cli"
    values={[
        {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
        {label: 'Docker Compose', value: 'docker'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="cli">

#### 1. Initialize node

<InitNode />

#### 2. Run node

<RunNode />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

#### 1. First build the image

```bash title="Terminal"
docker buildx build -t 'merod' .
```

#### 2. Then setup and run the nodes defined in `docker-compose.yml` file

```bash title="Terminal"
docker compose up
```

#### 3. Connect to the available node by listing running containers

```bash title="Terminal"
docker ps
```

and then attach to the selected container

```bash title="Node Terminal"
docker attach core-app_node_run-1
```

Wait for a few moments and node logs should appear.
