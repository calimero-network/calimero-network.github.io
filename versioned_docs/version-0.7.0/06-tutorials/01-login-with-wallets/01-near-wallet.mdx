## Logging in with NEAR Wallet

Calimero allows users to authenticate via their NEAR wallet, ensuring secure
access to the Admin Dashboard. The process of logging in with a NEAR wallet
involves the following steps:

### 1. User Initiates Login

- The user navigates to the Admin Dashboard and selects the option to "Login
  with NEAR Wallet."

### 2. Server Issues Challenge

- Upon selecting the login option, the server generates a challenge. This
  challenge is then presented to the user for signing.

### 3. Redirect to MyNearWallet

- The user is redirected to the [MyNearWallet](https://mynearwallet.com/) page,
  where they will be asked to sign the server-issued challenge using their NEAR
  wallet.

### 4. Signature Sent to Backend

- After the user signs the challenge, the signature is sent back to the server
  for verification.

### 5. Signature Verification

- The backend verifies the signature to ensure its authenticity. If the
  signature is valid, the user's public key is extracted from the signature and
  added as the user's unique identifier.
- This public key serves as the user's Decentralized Identifier (DID), not as a
  context-specific identity. The DID enables decentralized authentication,
  ensuring that the user can interact with the platform securely across
  different contexts and applications.

### 6. Successful Login

- Once verified, the user is successfully logged into the Admin Dashboard, with
  their public key (DID) serving as their user ID for future interactions.

This login flow ensures a secure and seamless authentication process leveraging
NEAR's robust blockchain-based security.
