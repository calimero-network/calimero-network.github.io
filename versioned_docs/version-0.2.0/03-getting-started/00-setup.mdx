<!-- todo: verify if needed
Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install
it by following the instructions on the
[Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

> **_NOTE:_** Use minimum rust version 1.80.0 -->

This guide will help you set up your local node.

Before you start, make sure you are familiar with
[Calimero Terminology](/learn/terminology) as we will use terms from the
terminology.

Setup consists of few steps and is around 10 minutes long. (mostly waiting for
project dependencies to download)

1. Clone repository from GitHub (1min)
2. Position in the root of the project (< 1min)
3. Create a data folder for all configuration files (< 1min)
4. Initialize and run node (~7 mins)

### 1. Clone repository from GitHub

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ssh"
    values={[
        {label: 'SSH', value: 'ssh'},
        {label: 'HTTPS', value: 'https'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="https">
```bash title="Clone using HTTPS"
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/core.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ssh">
```bash title="Clone using SSH"
git clone git@github.com:calimero-network/core.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Position in the root of the project

```bash title="Terminal"
cd core
```

### 3. Create a data folder for all configuration files.

```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir data
```

Your next step is to initialize and run the node.
