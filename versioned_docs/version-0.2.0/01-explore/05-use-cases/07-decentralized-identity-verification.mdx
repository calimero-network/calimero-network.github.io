title: Decentralized Identity Verification
---

Create a private Calimero application network which provides transparent and
trusted identity verification for service providers. With Calimero, sensitive
procedures such as opening a bank account or applying for Visas would not
require service providers to host the data of their users at centralized
entities any more.
