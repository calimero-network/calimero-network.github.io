title: Decentralized Social Platforms
---

Build social experiences which need scalable but private data like social
groups, direct messages and others, while eliminating high transaction costs
(gas fees associated with blockchains). This can include exclusive groups and
gated communities based on ownership of NFTs or token payments which would allow
participation and decryption of the community data content.
