## Why not IPFS?

IPFS is a storage solution, it's not designed for generic compute.

## Calimero vs IPFS

Calimero is designed to be a general-purpose compute engine that can be used to
build a wide variety of applications. Also worth noting that Calimero does offer
a way to store encrypted data, effectively making it a storage solution as well.
