## Logging in with Starknet

Calimero allows users to authenticate via their Starknet wallet, ensuring secure
access to the Admin Dashboard. The process of logging in with a Starknet wallet
involves the following steps:

### 1. User Initiates Login

- The user navigates to the Admin Dashboard and selects the option to "Login
  with Starknet."
- They are presented with two wallet options: ArgentX and Metamask Snap.

### 2. Wallet Selection

- The user chooses their preferred wallet: ArgentX or Metamask Snap.

### 3. Wallet Connection

#### For ArgentX:

- If ArgentX is installed, the user is prompted to connect their wallet.
- If not installed, the user is directed to install the ArgentX browser
  extension.

#### For Metamask Snap:

- If Metamask with Starknet Snap is installed, the user is prompted to connect.
- If not installed, the user is guided to install Metamask and the Starknet
  Snap.

### 4. Server Issues Challenge

- Upon selecting the wallet, the server generates a challenge. This challenge is
  then presented to the user for signing.

### 5. User Signs Challenge

- The user is prompted to sign the server-issued challenge using their selected
  Starknet wallet.

### 6. Signature Sent to Backend

- After the user signs the challenge, the signature is sent back to the server
  for verification.

### 7. Signature Verification

The backend verifies the signature to ensure its authenticity using a process
tailored to Starknet's cryptographic standards. This verification process
differs depending on whether the user is using ArgentX or Metamask Snap.

#### For ArgentX Wallets:

1. **On-Chain Verification**:

   - The signature is initially verified on-chain using the Starknet network.
   - A JSON-RPC call is made to the Starknet node, invoking the
     `isValidSignature` function on the user's wallet contract.
   - This on-chain verification ensures the signature's validity according to
     the wallet's implementation.

2. **Message Hash Verification**:
   - If the on-chain verification succeeds, an additional verification of the
     message hash is performed off-chain.
   - This step ensures the integrity of the signed message and prevents any
     tampering.

#### For Metamask Snap:

1. **Off-Chain Verification**:

   - The signature is verified off-chain using Starknet's cryptographic
     libraries.
   - This involves using the `verify` function from the `starknet_crypto`
     library to check the signature against the provided public key.

2. **Message Hash Verification**:
   - If the signature is valid, an additional verification of the message hash
     is performed.
   - This ensures the integrity of the signed message, similar to the ArgentX
     process.

#### Final Steps:

- If the signature and hash are valid, the user's Starknet address is extracted
  from the wallet address used in the verification process.
- This address serves as the user's Decentralized Identifier (DID), enabling
  decentralized authentication across different contexts and applications.

### 8. Successful Login

- Once verified, the user is successfully logged into the Admin Dashboard, with
  their Starknet address (DID) serving as their user ID for future interactions.

This login flow ensures a secure and seamless authentication process leveraging
Starknet's robust blockchain-based security.
