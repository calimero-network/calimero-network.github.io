## Logging in with Internet Identity

The login process with Internet Identity involves these key steps:

### 1. User Initiates Login

- The user navigates to the Admin Dashboard and selects the option to "Login
  with Internet Identity."

### 2. Challenge Preparation

- The system prepares a challenge (encoded as a session public key) before
  initiating the authentication process.

### 3. Internet Identity Authentication

- A popup window opens, connecting to the Internet Identity service.
- The user authenticates through this popup.
- The challenge (session public key) is sent to the II service.

### 4. Delegation Chain Retrieval

- Upon successful authentication, the II service creates and returns a
  delegation chain.
- This delegation chain includes cryptographic proofs of the user's
  authentication.

### 5. Processing the Authentication Result

- The application receives the delegation chain from the II service.
- It processes this data, extracting necessary information like the user's
  public key.

### 6. Login Request Preparation

- The application prepares a login request including:
  - The serialized delegation chain
  - The original challenge payload
  - Wallet metadata (ICP canister ID and wallet name)

### 7. Server-side Verification

- The login request is sent to the Calimero server.
- The server verifies the delegation chain and challenge.

### 8. Successful Login

- Upon successful verification, the user is logged in and directed to the
  identity page.
- The user's Internet Identity becomes their unique identifier for future
  interactions within the Calimero ecosystem.

This process leverages ICP's delegation chain mechanism for secure,
decentralized authentication.
