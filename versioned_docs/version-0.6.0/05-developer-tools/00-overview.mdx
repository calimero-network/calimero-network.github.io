We provide different tools for building decentralized applications.

### CLI Tools for interacting with the node and its functionalities

You can use CLI to interact with the node using the terminal.
[Merod](./CLI/merod) is a CLI tool for managing nodes. [Meroctl](./CLI/meroctl)
is tool for performing various operations with the node such as context
creationa or app installation.

### SDKs for building the application

Two primary SDKs are available:

[Protocol SDK](./SDK/protocol-sdk/protocol-sdk): Used for building WebAssembly
(WASM) application logic in Rust. Provide macros for identifying different
application components such as state, logic and events.

[Client SDK](./SDK/client-sdk/client-ts-sdk): Enables frontend development in
TypeScript, supporting wallet authentication and context data handling via
JSON-RPC and WebSockets.

### Apps for node administration throught the UI

- [Admin dashboard](./apps/admin-dashboard) is web interface for node admin api.
- [Desktop application](./apps/desktop-app) is a desktop interface for the node
  where node is available as a service on the local machine.

### Examples

We have few repositories that demonstrate how SDK can be used. Check our
