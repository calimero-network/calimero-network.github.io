# Calimero Network

> Calimero Network is a framework which enables building fully decentralized applications, ensuring everyone's data privacy through peer-to-peer Self-Sovereign applications with verified off-chain computing.

Calimero Network provides a comprehensive development framework for building decentralized applications that prioritize data ownership and privacy. The framework uses WebAssembly (WASM) for secure application execution and provides a robust runtime environment for managing peer-to-peer networks.
