Traditional notions of privacy, often centred around the control of personal information, have been challenged by the pervasive nature of digital technologies. In a world where your data flows freely across the internet, and is processed by centralized servers, the control over your personal information is often lost.

Rather than focusing solely on the individual's control over their data, contextual integrity considers the context-specific norms that govern information sharing and usage. Different social settings or spheres (e.g., healthcare, financial records, personal relationships and similar), different actors, attributes and conditions under which information is shared, each have their own expectations for information flow. By examining these parameters, contextual integrity provides a nuanced understanding of privacy that is sensitive to the specific social contexts in which information is used."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The digital environment involves numerous actors, including users, service providers, third-party advertisers, and data brokers.

For example, social media combines personal, professional and public spheres, challenging traditional privacy norms. Digital technologies enable the collection and analysis of vast amounts of diverse data, often beyond what individuals explicitly share. This includes metadata, behavioral data, and similar, which complicates consent and control and often gives away much more about the user than the user actually understands or wants to share.
